Because we focus on distress classification, we report precision, recall and F-measure for the distress class, which combines LD and HD into a single class with respect to binary (distress vs.\ non-distress) classification. In each case, a held-out set of 100 randomly selected tweets compose the test set and the remaining 900 tweets from that annotator compose the training set. The last row shows when the two training sets (respectively, test sets) are combined into a single set of 1800 (respectively, 200) tweets. \relax }}{10}{table.caption.10}
