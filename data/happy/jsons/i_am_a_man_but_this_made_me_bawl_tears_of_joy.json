I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with depression since 2009 and although I had friends and was kinda popular and an athlete, I always felt out of place and unwanted. Then Jr. year I destroyed my knee.

Now immediately I thought she was different,weird and a clown but I was hooked. She became my sister&amp;#39;s best friend and I started seeing her more and more at my house. Fast forward to July 2013 and we movrd to her apartment complex. We got closer and started talking.

I went in the shower when I got home.All those years of feeling like shit washed away with my tears. I couldn&amp;#39;t control them and they just started coming out.
