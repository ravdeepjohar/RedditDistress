I had been smoking for seven years. \n\nI began seriously contemplating what I would like to do for my future, and what makes me happy and would make me happy for a long, long time. I chose my career, after a lot of dodgy starts and emotional roller-coasters, and began a college course that would aid me in getting where I hoped to be. (If it helps, I wrote a list of all the positive and negative aspects about myself, what makes me happy, and what I could change upon that list and what I would have to live with, and learn to love) I developed an amazing confidence when I started to support and take a role within my own choices and decisions within my day-to-day life. I began to love my body, and my confidence has soared sky-high with the fact that I understand that even if my body is not the iota of perfection, it is me and I'm very proud of that. \n\nI very **safely** stopped taking my antidepressants, which I believe has changed and aided me magnificently for the better. \nI cut my long hair off, after having the same style for 2-3 years. \nI began reading the bible. \n\nOne of the hardest signifying points for me, was when I realised that I had been reflecting my depression into my relationship, and that my sadness was mainly my own fault. I began taking authority and dominance within my own life, and I also started to communicate simplistically and to the point upon when I was sad, what caused it, and how I needed support; the first part was admitting that I needed help, just alike to when I gave up smoking, I had to admit that I was really just a drug addict. Now, due to these little changes, my relationship has never been more wonderful! :-) \n\nAll in all, I was just so very tired and depressed, with my depression, and I knew something had to change, which was myself. I kicked myself up the arse, because I'm so very lucky to be who I am, and to have who and what I have.  I looked at myself, and realised that that is not who I wanted to be, someone whom pushes everyone away and cries themselves to sleep. I had no purpose. For the first time, I am truly looking forward to the things in my life. I'm truly so very happy but I'm not finished yet, I still may have little bumps upon the great road to recovery but that's alright, because I'm still growing; I still have so many things to concur and do:\n\nRun a marathon for fibromyalgia.

I had been smoking for seven years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I began seriously contemplating what I would like to do for my future, and what makes me happy and would make me happy for a long, long time. I chose my career, after a lot of dodgy starts and emotional roller-coasters, and began a college course that would aid me in getting where I hoped to be. (If it helps, I wrote a list of all the positive and negative aspects about myself, what makes me happy, and what I could change upon that list and what I would have to live with, and learn to love) I developed an amazing confidence when I started to support and take a role within my own choices and decisions within my day-to-day life. I began to love my body, and my confidence has soared sky-high with the fact that I understand that even if my body is not the iota of perfection, it is me and I&amp;#39;m very proud of that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I very &lt;strong&gt;safely&lt;/strong&gt; stopped taking my antidepressants, which I believe has changed and aided me magnificently for the better. \nI cut my long hair off, after having the same style for 2-3 years. \nI began reading the bible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest signifying points for me, was when I realised that I had been reflecting my depression into my relationship, and that my sadness was mainly my own fault. I began taking authority and dominance within my own life, and I also started to communicate simplistically and to the point upon when I was sad, what caused it, and how I needed support; the first part was admitting that I needed help, just alike to when I gave up smoking, I had to admit that I was really just a drug addict. Now, due to these little changes, my relationship has never been more wonderful! :-) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, I was just so very tired and depressed, with my depression, and I knew something had to change, which was myself. I kicked myself up the arse, because I&amp;#39;m so very lucky to be who I am, and to have who and what I have.  I looked at myself, and realised that that is not who I wanted to be, someone whom pushes everyone away and cries themselves to sleep. I had no purpose. For the first time, I am truly looking forward to the things in my life. I&amp;#39;m truly so very happy but I&amp;#39;m not finished yet, I still may have little bumps upon the great road to recovery but that&amp;#39;s alright, because I&amp;#39;m still growing; I still have so many things to concur and do:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Run a marathon for fibromyalgia. Climb Kilimanjaro for cancer.\nFinish college. Get married. Have a family. Learn Welsh. Save up for a road bike. Eat. Dance. Sing. Party. Go to Karaoke. Go to University. Teach. Help someone.
