I want to work in the health care industry in the future so this was pretty exciting to me. We were all happy, being selected out of a pool of 150~ students. I had a great time, I learned a lot and I had fun talking and joking around with my classmates, teachers, and doctors/PAs/nurses. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all had to get there by 8 am on our own. Though I have my license, I don\u2019t have a car so I had to get a ride from my uncle, but I didn\u2019t have a ride back from the health center. The trip was supposed to end at around 1 pm, but we ended a couple hours earlier. I made sure to get a ride back to school after the trip because I didn\u2019t want to miss seventh bell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only one other student out of the eleven other students and two teachers that went on the trip wanted to go back to school. The rest went home, or where ever. I didn\u2019t know her at all, she was a senior, and I a junior, we don\u2019t typically interact. Neither of us wanted to back to school until seventh bell, so we decided to go out to lunch to kill off a couple hours until seventh bell. The car ride back to town was really nice. We had such a genuine conversation. The simple human interaction was just so welcomed and needed. I\u2019ve been fighting depression for a long time, and that was just something that never really experienced. We talked about a lot of things. We talked about school, grades, our college plans, and our dreams of going in to the health care industry. It was such a nice thing to talk to someone I don\u2019t know, and actually get to know her. I never realized how much meaning it had for me to interact and share words with others. We were just getting to know each other, and that was really nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We decided the best place to go and eat to kill time was a Chinese buffet near our school. We went in there, two high school students in a restaurant at lunch time, when all the business people are out eating in restaurants. We definitely stuck out, people were staring at us. But I think it had more to do with her being a petite white girl, and me being a black guy. I just shrugged it off, I didn\u2019t want to go back to school until seventh bell, and I wanted to eat some Chinese food. We ate for like an hour and a half. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever eaten so much Chinese food in a single sitting. We continued talking about school, her college boyfriend, our friends and family, my attempt at trying to get a girl in my grade to like me, etc. I\u2019ve never really experienced something like that with someone I just met, I was so happy. I didn\u2019t want that day to end; it was all so genuine and real. But alas, after bellies full of food, she drove me back to school and we went our separate ways. I went to my seventh bell class, and she went to hers. I don\u2019t know how else to explain it, the day, the moment, it was all just real. I am very happy to have experienced this and to have made such a friend, if only for a couple hours. I haven\u2019t seen her in the hallways, but if I do I\u2019ll probably wave and say hi, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be the same. Regardless, I am happy to have met her, and hope to share something like this with others.
