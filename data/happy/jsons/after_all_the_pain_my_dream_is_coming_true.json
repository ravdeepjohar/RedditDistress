I recently had my final exams for high school and when I got my report card I found out that I was 2 % under the acceptance for the universities. Plus while I was trying to study my ex refused to talk to me, in a way he was trying to teach me a lesson - I guess to give him space, I&amp;#39;m not sure. My dream was to become an animator but because of the pain that was happening during my final exams I gave up on it and changed all the programs I wanted from animation to business. After my exams I went through a horrible time because of my sister. I went into a horrible type of depressed state and then after a few weeks I started to work out again and went on dates then I decided I would give animation another try. Now I have been accepted in the my first choice program and I have become the apprentice of the lead animator at a large video game company. I&amp;#39;m happy now and focusing on my art and the ones who genuinely care about me. These past few months have taught me that to get to your dreams you have to strive for it and be a better person. Dreams don&amp;#39;t come easy and if you really want to get it sometimes you have to get through all the pain that life will throw at you because there&amp;#39;s always something to look forward too.
