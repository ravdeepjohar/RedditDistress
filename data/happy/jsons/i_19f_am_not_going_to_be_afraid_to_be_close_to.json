On a normal day I\u2019m reserved and pretty removed. I feel like I seem cold most of the time. I\u2019ve learned a lot about myself in the last year, and now I\u2019m going to work on the problems I have which limit me from being truly happy. I have problems with abandonment, and trust, and I\u2019ve felt like I\u2019ll always be rejected or anything but someone\u2019s first choice in people or girlfriends. In my past, I faced emotional, verbal, and sexual abuse as well as rejection. Not the worst things, but they were definitely deep rooted and they ruled me. They ruled my relationships. It\u2019s very hard for me to enjoy the sex in my relationships. I don\u2019t feel vulnerable or close when I do anything sexual because I trained myself to shut down and just do it when the time comes. I thought that it would help me get over my past if I just shut it out. I found someone who I want to be close to, and so far we&amp;#39;ve had a great relationship. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other night, I had a nightmare that I caught him with another woman and there was nothing I could do to stop them. It wasn\u2019t my usual type of nightmare, but it\u2019s one that I won\u2019t have again. The context seemed like we were in an open relationship, and I didn\u2019t agree with it. I just stood there hopeless and broken hearted, and he kept asking me \u201cWhat..?\u201d I know that that is something that he will never do to me, but I realized that I need to confront my fear. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m afraid of being close to someone, or afraid that they\u2019ll find out something that they don\u2019t like and leave. If I confront it, my dreams won&amp;#39;t be as painful. If i confront this, I can learn to trust people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I already told my boyfriend that I was sexually abused, and he is very supportive, but didn\u2019t understand it like I do. I try to explain, but I never said what I really needed to say until this day. I can talk to him about these things because he wants to help me, but he doesn\u2019t look at me like I\u2019m a kicked puppy. The day after the nightmare, I felt completely vulnerable. I was hurt because of a dream I had, and I thought too much about my past. I just wanted to cuddle something or drive. Mostly, I wanted to see him to confirm that he was still my man. I called him and went to his house for a casual movie or whatever we wanted. When he opened the door, I felt completely leveled by him. I\u2019m so close to this person, and I\u2019m terrified by it, but want to be closer. Later that night, I told him everything I was rehearsing throughout the day, and it was so relieving. I told him that I\u2019ve never really let myself be close to anyone, but that with him, I didn\u2019t know how not to be close. I don\u2019t know how not to care about him. I told him that I \u201ctease\u201d him in bed because I do want to do sexual things with him, but lately, when it\u2019s in action, I freeze. I don\u2019t want to shut myself off like I did before. With him, I want a connection that makes us a couple. I want to stop the cycle that makes sex nothing more to me than reenactments of my past, and keeps me from forgetting my dad\u2019s greedy stare. I told my boyfriend that some days, I can\u2019t shake it, and I don\u2019t want to be touched. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What happened next was what I needed to happen for a long time. He squeezed me and told me that he loved all the little things about me. He complimented my body, and for the first time, I believed him. He made me believe that if he wanted sex above anything else, I would\u2019ve known by now like I unfortunately learned about a couple past boyfriends. He told me that he wanted to help me work through my problems. He suggested that the next time I wanted to do something sexual, we can stop the moment I feel uncomfortable. I think I know that it won\u2019t be a problem anymore because I know that he is aware, and he is so supportive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like it\u2019s the start of a new life for me where I can have close relationships with my friends and maybe my family too. I have such a free feeling now, and I want to take this boy to all the places we want to see once we have money. I want to do everything with this person. I\u2019m taking baby steps in my relationships, but I\u2019m finally taking steps! I couldn\u2019t be happier about this, and I\u2019m so lucky to have people in my life like him. I\u2019m lucky to have been able to do this before I push him or anyone else away.
