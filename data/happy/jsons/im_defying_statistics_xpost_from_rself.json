My main concern in regards to doing so is that this may seem self-indulgent. Putting aside my anxiety, I\u2019ve decided to post this as a form of gratitude, to pass on some uplifting news and to maybe even give a bit of hope to others who are in a similar boat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am content in my life. This is a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was raised by my father. We were very poor. My father is a man who suffers from drug addiction, alcoholism and anger management issues. As a result, I was raised in a very abusive environment. I was abused daily, whether it was verbal, emotional or physical. To give you a glimpse of what my abuse entailed: my father would smash my face into a mirror for having a pimple, and I was strangled for walking into the kitchen to get a glass of water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was raised in a household where multitudes of strangers would walk in throughout the day to buy weed, where I would heat up a plate in the microwave for my dad and his mates to snort coke off, where I would find used needles in the Tupperware cupboard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mother also suffered drug addiction and was beaten by my father. They separated when I was two and she developed a mental illness known as schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was 14 I reported my father to authorities (in Australia this was the cops and DOCS), and after battling for 6 months it was decided by DOCS that I was making it all up for attention, so I was moved back home after living in a youth refuge. When I returned the abuse continued and I ultimately moved out when I was 15.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since moving out I have battled with depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, an eating disorder and a slight dissociative disorder. There have been multiple suicide attempts. I developed a serious addiction to pot. I entered into a not-so healthy relationship with someone from a similar background and we enabled each other\u2019s addictions. We stayed together for three years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of our relationship I realised I was getting nowhere in my life. I had goals I wanted to achieve, and instead of doing something about them I was spending all of my pay check on rent and weed and sitting inside playing video games all day (don\u2019t get me wrong, I loved this, but when it\u2019s all you do every day for three years... well... it\u2019s not healthy). So when we parted ways, I endeavoured to make my life just a bit better. So since January last year, I\u2019ve set out on my journey. This is what I\u2019ve accomplished:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Started a new full time job working in a company filled with incredible, supportive people\n-Got over my weed addiction\n-Put ON ten kgs\n-Got back in touch with old friends, and made some new ones. I\u2019m now surrounded by the best friends I have ever had\n-Started my full time degree; I\u2019m doing a Bachelor in Behavioural Studies which I plan to use to get into social work and humanitarian aid\n-Moved into a house with cheaper rent\n-Paid off my $4000 debt\n-Started taking medication for my anxiety and depression\n-Started exercising daily and eating clean&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of the changes I have made in my life have been due to some serious support from some amazing people. I don\u2019t have any sort of stable home or family unit, and rely on my friends a lot for the support one would usually get from family. They are the ones I turn to for advice, when I\u2019m having a shitty time or when I want to boast about my grades. And for the first time in my life, I\u2019m not bursting into tears for no reason, I feel like I have a purpose and that I\u2019m actually going somewhere, I go out and meet new people and do new things and I am absolutely destroying uni (in the best possible way). The thing that makes me feel best though, is that through my study I\u2019m learning that the way I am leading my life right now is actually beating the odds. Through determination and support, I am defying statistics, and so can you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR; life was shit, now it\u2019s rad&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I have been wrestling with myself over the past week about writing this and posting it to you all.
