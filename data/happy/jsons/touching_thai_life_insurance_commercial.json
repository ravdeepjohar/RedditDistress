It is a thing I very much life. You will note that I was, after all, watching it in the first place, and watch such things a lot. Now, can you believe that in making these observations, I view myself as, and actually feel like, the man in the commercial? Even to the point that I feel obliged, *as the man in the commercial*, to say that shutting down \"critical\", or cautionary, remarks *for the sake of some nice feeling* represents a real danger, and a very common one. But please, please, please take this in the spirit in intended, as it is more my spirit than you have any idea: when I go so far as to criticize the tendency to push away critical remarks, at least the self-indulgent kind, as presenting a kind of danger, can you believe that I am indeed feeling like the man in the commercial? That that *is* my way of pushing up the cart, giving the dog the food, hanging the fruit on the door? I *love* the message of that commercial more than anything in the world. \n\nAnd I feel this point more than anything in the world. I have seen and fallen through many of the cracks made by those who wish for their \"two minutes of nice feelings\", one might say, who want to shut down these \"extraneous observations\", \"gratiutous downers\", etc. There, in the world, in my history, and I know in the lives of so many, there are people dangling on the edges of curbs with heavy carts, trotting dogs with wagging tails wishing for some fooed and simple affection, shut-ins who can barely get to the door for a scrap of food, all due to the forcefully shutting down of so much extraneous, critical information. And at the same time, they are there *because* so many of whose who criticize, for their part, get lost in the negative moment. Many in that critical mode happen upon that siimple reversal of \"niceness\" as if it is the greatest realization in the world, and they proceed to do nothing but that for the rest of their lives, no matter that the limitations of that approach are enormous. Nothing will dissuade them, as you have attempted to do with me here, from proceeding with their \"Debbie Downer\" critical approach. Riding on their modicum of truth, they plow ahead, but don't realize that tney, too, do their part to create the cracks through which so many fall.\n\nLook in my user page. If you search for the term \"niceness\" (you might have to go back a bit), you'll find some fairly recent posts that are critical of the limits of such a critical approach. So honestly, I could not agree with  you more. \n\nBut to me then it amounts to a simple question: what sort of person are you? Are you a) the kind who just wants their bit of nice feelings without those pesky interruptions, b) the sort who wants only to be critical, for a potentially good reason, or not, but failing to move beyond that, or c) the kind I am: who really loves the basic idea of the commercial, who belives in it more than anything else in the wrold, who lives and feels it in every step, the positive ones *and* the negative ones? \n\nI know this is much more than you wanted to hear in response.

I have seen and fallen through many of the cracks made by those who wish for their &amp;quot;two minutes of nice feelings&amp;quot;, one might say, who want to shut down these &amp;quot;extraneous observations&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;gratiutous downers&amp;quot;, etc. There, in the world, in my history, and I know in the lives of so many, there are people dangling on the edges of curbs with heavy carts, trotting dogs with wagging tails wishing for some fooed and simple affection, shut-ins who can barely get to the door for a scrap of food, all due to the forcefully shutting down of so much extraneous, critical information. And at the same time, they are there &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; so many of whose who criticize, for their part, get lost in the negative moment. Many in that critical mode happen upon that siimple reversal of &amp;quot;niceness&amp;quot; as if it is the greatest realization in the world, and they proceed to do nothing but that for the rest of their lives, no matter that the limitations of that approach are enormous. Nothing will dissuade them, as you have attempted to do with me here, from proceeding with their &amp;quot;Debbie Downer&amp;quot; critical approach. Riding on their modicum of truth, they plow ahead, but don&amp;#39;t realize that tney, too, do their part to create the cracks through which so many fall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look in my user page. If you search for the term &amp;quot;niceness&amp;quot; (you might have to go back a bit), you&amp;#39;ll find some fairly recent posts that are critical of the limits of such a critical approach. So honestly, I could not agree with  you more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to me then it amounts to a simple question: what sort of person are you? Are you a) the kind who just wants their bit of nice feelings without those pesky interruptions, b) the sort who wants only to be critical, for a potentially good reason, or not, but failing to move beyond that, or c) the kind I am: who really loves the basic idea of the commercial, who belives in it more than anything else in the wrold, who lives and feels it in every step, the positive ones &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the negative ones? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this is much more than you wanted to hear in response. But it just so happens that this is who I am.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_23s0qv", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ch0hptd", "created": 1398310221.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1398306621.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "saved": false, "id": "ch070na", "gilded": 0, "author": "rainnthunder", "parent_id": "t1_ch05u85", "approved_by": null, "body": "Plant's pot has holes.
