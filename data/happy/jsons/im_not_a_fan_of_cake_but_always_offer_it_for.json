Bostongurka was invented by the &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden\"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; company &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AB_Felix\"&gt;Felix&lt;/a&gt; based on a recipe from &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary\"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally invented as a way to use the leftover end pieces that are left when making pickled cucumber slices. Today, the name Bostongurka is a registered &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark\"&gt;trademark&lt;/a&gt; of Procordia Foods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/2SWIsqY.jpg\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bostongurka.JPG\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Jar with Bostongurka.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Interesting:&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relish\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Relish&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup&gt;|&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lihapiirakka_(pastry)\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Lihapiirakka&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;(pastry)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup&gt;|&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Felix\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Herbert&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Felix&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup&gt;|&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pickled_foods\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;List&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;of&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;pickled&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;foods&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Parent&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;commenter&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;can&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;amp;subject=AutoWikibot%20NSFW%20toggle&amp;amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cg48o0j\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;toggle&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;NSFW&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup&gt;or&lt;a href=\"#or\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;amp;subject=AutoWikibot%20Deletion&amp;amp;message=%2Bdelete+cg48o0j\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;delete&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Will&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;also&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;delete&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;on&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;comment&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;score&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;of&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;or&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;less.&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;|&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;FAQs&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup&gt;|&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Mods&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup&gt;|&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Magic&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Words&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_20j31u", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cg48o0j", "created": 1395009713.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1395006113.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh5i", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "happy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "saved": false, "id": "cg499pw", "gilded": 0, "author": "HiveJiveLive", "parent_id": "t1_cg48ntx", "approved_by": null, "body": "I personally love tuna, but saw some really amazing variations.
