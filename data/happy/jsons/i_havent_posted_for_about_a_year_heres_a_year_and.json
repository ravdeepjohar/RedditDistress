Nowadays ( MANY years later), except for a few (still fading) scars, you would never know I had the serious pizza face I used to have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever you&amp;#39;re doing, keep it up - you&amp;#39;re looking great!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_2595lb", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_chf2nxr", "created": 1399829381.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1399800581.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh5i", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "happy", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh5i", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "happy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "saved": false, "id": "chf4rbs", "gilded": 0, "author": "vivolleyball15", "parent_id": "t1_chf2sv6", "approved_by": null, "body": "No it's a Fairy Tail symbol.
