Alone. Away from other people. I am a senior almost half way through my spring semester.\nIt is Thursday.\nI realized that I have a lot of problems with My college.\nEvery time I say that I hate My college, I become more alienated. Like it can hear me.\nMy college punishes you if you don\u2019t like him/it/her/whatever.\nWhat does that make me if I don\u2019t like My college.\nFreedom of speech right?\nI can say and think what I want.\nWhy does My college have to make me think and say things in a certain way?\nFuck my college.\nThat&amp;#39;s right.\nFuck.\nMy.\nCollege.\nThe pros of My college are this:\nProvides me food, a place to live, something to do, gives me an education, which will get me a job, which will get me money. Gives me \u201copportunities\u201d. I put that in quotes because I don\u2019t necessarily think that these opportunities are full of worth.\nAll people do in the world is try and make their life situation better. Sometimes, making one\u2019s life situation becomes a selfish act. An act that can hurt others.\nSomali pirates hurt capt. Phillips so they can get money, so they can improve their shitty life in their corrupt country.\nHow can we blame them.\nAmerica. Killed innocent native tribes people to gain more land. That is selfish. That is murder.\nThe reason why we have this country is because we kicked out the people who lived here before us.\nSo we learn from our mistakes right?\nMy college creates an army.\nYou have to be good to get accepted into this army.\nOnce your in it is a dog fight to be the best soldier.\nIf you pass the trials at my college army camp, you can crush the competition in the real world.\nMy college breeds us to be more competitive, but what that means is that it breeds us to crush the competition.\nSo fuck the people that aren\u2019t as good as you.\nFuck this college, fuck that college, fuck all those colleges that aren\u2019t as good as us.\nBeat them.\nIt is not just school spirit.\nIt is a cutthroat competition.\nCutthroat.\nSure we follow the U.S. justice system, which has come a long way. But there are still many injustices in this world\nExample.\nWalk in to a party and smile at people and say hello. People look away and don\u2019t initiate a conversation with you because they think your weird because you are different.\nSocial injustice.\nThey are leaving me to starve.\nThey are outcasting me.\nThey are alienating me.\nThey are inflicting PAIN on me when they could help me.\nBut if they help me than they will be seen as weird too.\nDo you see that problem!!!\nWe spend an equal amount of ENERGY hurting people when we could as much energy helping them, which in turn would create more benefits (happiness, well-being, increased mood, etc.).\nBut we are a selfish. Machismo. Dog eat dog culture.\nEveryone has to be tough.\nSo nobody gives anything away to easily.\nWe are rigid.\nWe are stone.\nWe don not budge.\nWe do not give a fuck about other people.\nMy college. A community of students and professors where people learn in harmony, fostering great relationships and work together in social, academic and extracurricular environments to promote well-being and learning.\nThat is what colleges advertise themselves as.\nThis is what a college is.\nPeople walking past each other on the quad not saying hello to each other but glaring at each other defensively.\nPeople can\u2019t be too nice because that is weak.\nThat is gay.\nThat is not manly.\nThat is not cool.\nWell FUCK THOSE MOTHERFUCKING STANDARDS!!!!!!\nI HATE THESE RULES!\nAll these rules do is cause pain.\nIf we did not have them than everyone would say hello to everyone.\nEveryone would help everyone in need.\nWhy is there this need to compete???????\nWHY DO WE CONSTANTLY HAVE TO PUT ON A SHOW???????\nWHY DO WE NEED TO COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME??????\nIs it animal instincts?\nBreeding instincts?\nWe need to eat right?\nIn order to eat we need to be strong.\nBeing strong gets you food.\nGetting food grows your sperm. Makes you able to make offspring.\nIS that why we compete?\nOr is it that we need are addicted to this feeling of winning.\nFuck winning.\nI just want to be happy.\nI would help anyone be happy.\nThe only way I can get peoples respect/help is by seeming cool.\nNo one will stoop down and help poor me if I am in trouble.\nMy ideal world is this.\nSome one is in trouble. Everyone helps them.\nEveryone helps everyone be as happy as they can.\nDo you see how great that would be!!!!!??????\nThere would be no problems!!!!!!\nBut that cant fucking happen!!!!\nWhy?\nThe fucking ego.\nEGO. Is the great problem of the human race.\nMust be big fish in pond.\nLittle fish no good.\nEvery problem we have.\nRacism.\nHomosexuality.\nHate.\nJealousy.\nWould be solved, if everyone helped everyone. If people felt good about making other people happy. And if no one took a selfish step forward unless that decision benefited everyone.\nExample.\nHere we are in this utopian world were everyone is happy. Everyone helps everyone.\nBeautiful woman is lying naked on the grass. Clothes are not needed in this world because nobody cares what anyone looks like. No one feels bad about how they look.\nMan comes up to woman and wants to have sex with her.\nAnother man comes up a few seconds later and also wants to have sex with beautiful woman.\nWoman wants to have sex with second man.\nThere are three wants. That can\u2019t fit together. Before anything happens. A solution must be made in which everyone wins equally.\nBeautiful woman knows another woman who is just as beautiful that would want to have sex with the second man. She finds her and asks her if she would have sex with this man and she willingly agrees.\nBoth partners have sex and are happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second example\nBeautiful women is lying on the grass and an ugly man walks up to her and wants to have sex with her.\nBeautiful women is not as naturally aroused to this man. But says to ugly man. I will help you find a women that is appeals to you and that would want to have sex with you. They look for a women but cannot find one.\nBeautiful woman agrees to have sex with less attractive man but he must do her a favor of equal value. He must help her build her house for a certain amount of days. They both agree it would be 3 days.\nThe agreement is made.\nEveryone wins.\n The world will be a constant orgy of everyone pleasing everyone equally. Everyone will be fucking everyone one.\nSocial fucking.\nBrain stimulation fucking by sharing intelligence.\nHouse fucking. Everyone has shelter and warmth.\nFood fucking. Everyone has enough nutritious food.\nBut what about the people who provide the food? How will they be repaid?\nFarmers will make food as best as they can. They can eat their share of food just for making their food.\nIf their food rots because of too much rain they still get their food.\nIf their food dries up because of a drought they still get their food.\nIf all of the food in the world rots or dries up. It will be partitioned equally amongst those who are in existence.\nSuffering will be spread perfectly equally.\nIf someone would like to sacrifice themselves as food than they can do so.\nA possibility of this occurring could happen as the world can be thrown into horrendous environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think of the Siberian flood basalts erupting, releasing terrible acid rain into the air, Co2 killing off the animals in the oceans.\nBut. With modern technology. Shelter from these elements could be provided for everyone.\nWho wants to die?\nPeople naturally want to live?\nA rule must be enacted. Where you cannot save your life and thereby causing the death of another person.\nThere will be no hate.\nNo winning.\nNo losing.\nJust everyone being happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to do something good you can do it.\nThere will be no awards for it.\nJust people enjoying what you made.\nNo compliments.\nJust enjoying your creation like a drug.\nEveryone iota of happiness that is felt in your body will be enjoyed, not commented on, not classified, not bragged about, not boasted about. Just felt into oblivion.\nEveryone will reach a nirvana.\nThere will be no bad feelings.\nEveryone will be so happy.\nThere will be no problems.\nI love all of you.\nI want to love all of you.\nLet me in.\nLet me love you.\nDon&amp;#39;t be afraid of my love.\nDon&amp;#39;t be afraid of what others think of my love.\nIf someone hugs you it is nice isn\u2019t it?\nBut when someone hugs you in public you retract because you are afraid of what other people think.\nIf someone hugs you and you are alone in a room. You retract because you don\u2019t want to feel like you are a baby, or weak, or create unwanted sexual tensions, or make the other person feel weird.\nFuck that.\nWhen you are a baby, you no nothing of reputation.\nYou don\u2019t know about what is bad and what is good.\nIf someone hugs you and you are a baby, it feels good, and you want that hug. You want that hug to last forever.\nWe still have that want. Even if we are 15, 21, 56 years old. Hold onto that hug.\nEveryone wants that hug.\nLet me hug you.\nLet others hug you.\nHug others.\nLet us all hug each other.\nDO NOT EVER TELL ME YOU DON\u2019T LIKE BEING HUGGED.\nTHIS IS NOT FUCKING FUNNY.\nDO NOT MAKE A JOKE OF THIS.\nTHIS IS MY SERIOUS ARGUMENT.\nPEOPLE LOVE TO FEEL GOOD BUT TURN IT DOWN ALL THE MOTHERFUCKING TIME BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF WHAT OTHER PEOPLE WILL THINK OF THEM.\nIf everyone wants love. If everyone gives love. Everyone will be loved. This is flawless.\nThis is an airtight ball of clay. That is what humans can be. A ball of clay. No limbs. No different colors. No king/queen. No loser. Everyone is equally happy. We have to technology and resources for everyone on earth to be happy.
