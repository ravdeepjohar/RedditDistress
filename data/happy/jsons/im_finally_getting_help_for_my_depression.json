You might know some of this, but maybe you'll take something from it.\n\nYou've probably heard of depression as a \"chemical imbalance\" and that's fairly accurate. Low amounts of serotonin (a neurotransmitter in the brain) put an individual at a predisposition to suffering from a depression. That combined with a number of different sociological factors will cause the typical symptoms that I likely don't have to describe for you. So depression tends to be a two-part issue where a biological and sociological factor come together to cause the disorder.\n\nWhat does that mean in terms of treatment? As you've noted both medication and therapy are options. What do most physicians and therapists recommend? Both! By doing both you can tackle both factors of the disorder and by doing this the odds of seeing progress with treating the disorder are drastically higher than either one on their own (I don't have the studies on hand to back it up, but they are definitely there and if necessarily I'd be happy to find them).\n\nNow in your case specifically, it's important to know that everyone is different and there are varying degrees of depression. In major depressive disorder it can get to the point where functioning normally in day-to-day life becomes nearly impossible (unable to go to school/work, etc.). Does that sound similar to yourself? You also state:\n\n&gt;They tried putting me on some pill for a while, but it didn't help and I disliked the idea of being on a medication that I couldn't be sure was helping or hurting me. I stopped taking it, and have continued to struggle with depression.\n\nDo you remember exactly what pill you were given? A very large majority of the time an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) is prescribed to treat depression and anxiety disorders. How these work is that between nerve cells there is a space called the synaptic cleft where neurotransmitters are sent across to the next cell. There's a pretty good picture [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse). Not all neurotransmitters make it across the synaptic cleft and are instead \"reuptaken\" into the cell they were sent from. The purpose of the SSRI is to inhibit the amount of serotonin that gets reuptaken and gives the serotonin a better chance of making it across the synaptic cleft and acts to rebalance the chemical imbalance mentioned previously. SSRIs are very safe to take with a lot of the side-effects stemming from just getting used to the medication (nausea, dizziness) and go away once to individual has acclimated to the medication. The big part I want to note is that SSRIs actually take quite a bit to start making a noticeable difference to an individual suffering from depression (several weeks to a month), and before that it's not uncommon that the people surrounding the individual with depression will notice improvements first. A patient will usually start with a small dose and as they notice improvements, the dosage is increased until the individual feels significant improvement over their previous state. If you could give some clarification of what medicine you were taking and for how long that would help in understanding what might have been the issue.\n\nIn terms of waiting to take the medication, that is probably the worst advice considering how long it takes for it to start working. Since it is considered a very safe drug, even if they weren't correctly diagnosed, it wouldn't pose a threat to them to take it. Seeing a therapist is great but it definitely doesn't work for everyone. I'm switching to anecdotal evidence now, but I helped someone very close to me with MDD and they attempted therapy along with medication, but the therapy ended up making them more anxious and they weren't able to get comfortable opening up to a stranger. With increasing doses of the SSRI they now take, they went from not being able to get out of bed and failing classes to being almost finished with college. There is definitely no harm in trying the medication for a while and seeing if after about a month there is any difference.\n\nI'm sorry for the mega-wall of text but seeing as I've studied this and have personal experience, I thought I might give some info to you that might be of some help. If you have any questions for me, I'd be very happy to answer them to the best of my ability or refer you to someone who knows better than myself.\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 2, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to preface this by saying I think you mean well, but considering I&amp;#39;ve studied the issue in multiple classes I&amp;#39;ve taken I&amp;#39;ll give you some basic info about depression and the medication used to treat it. You might know some of this, but maybe you&amp;#39;ll take something from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve probably heard of depression as a &amp;quot;chemical imbalance&amp;quot; and that&amp;#39;s fairly accurate. Low amounts of serotonin (a neurotransmitter in the brain) put an individual at a predisposition to suffering from a depression. That combined with a number of different sociological factors will cause the typical symptoms that I likely don&amp;#39;t have to describe for you. So depression tends to be a two-part issue where a biological and sociological factor come together to cause the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What does that mean in terms of treatment? As you&amp;#39;ve noted both medication and therapy are options. What do most physicians and therapists recommend? Both! By doing both you can tackle both factors of the disorder and by doing this the odds of seeing progress with treating the disorder are drastically higher than either one on their own (I don&amp;#39;t have the studies on hand to back it up, but they are definitely there and if necessarily I&amp;#39;d be happy to find them).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now in your case specifically, it&amp;#39;s important to know that everyone is different and there are varying degrees of depression. In major depressive disorder it can get to the point where functioning normally in day-to-day life becomes nearly impossible (unable to go to school/work, etc.). Does that sound similar to yourself? You also state:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They tried putting me on some pill for a while, but it didn&amp;#39;t help and I disliked the idea of being on a medication that I couldn&amp;#39;t be sure was helping or hurting me. I stopped taking it, and have continued to struggle with depression.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you remember exactly what pill you were given? A very large majority of the time an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) is prescribed to treat depression and anxiety disorders. How these work is that between nerve cells there is a space called the synaptic cleft where neurotransmitters are sent across to the next cell. There&amp;#39;s a pretty good picture &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Not all neurotransmitters make it across the synaptic cleft and are instead &amp;quot;reuptaken&amp;quot; into the cell they were sent from.
