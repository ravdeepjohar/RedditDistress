I&amp;#39;ve been too embarrassed about it to barely even let my own husband of 3 years see me completely naked. And too embarrassed to see a dermatologist about it. It was just one of those &amp;quot;out of sight, out of mind&amp;quot; kind of things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well anyway, I read the other night that apparently Selsun Blue, the anti-dandruff shampoo, can be used topically on Tinea and the active ingredient, selenium sulfide, will get rid of the yeast by slowing its growth  over multiple applications. So, I went out and got a bottle of the &amp;quot;Medicated&amp;quot; strength Selsun Blue, and took a note from Tobias Funke&amp;#39;s book and blued myself (let it sit on the skin for a while then rinsed it off). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve sat in the bathtub covered in blue stuff for three nights in a row now... and I&amp;#39;m so, so happy to say that after just three applications, the Tinea on my body that has been an embarrassment to me for so long is BARELY noticeable any more!
