She was 7 and I was 6 when we met on the very first day. She was the only person to talk to me, the new kid, and we&amp;#39;ve stuck by each other&amp;#39;s side through everything (fantastic to absolutely horrible) ever since. I&amp;#39;m 23 and she&amp;#39;s 24 now and I have no idea what I would have done/would do without her and she feels the same. \nBesides that, I have many other close friends from elementary, a few from high school, and I got my best guy friend in college :) Him and I have already expressed how we never want to lose each other, ever. I&amp;#39;ve never met a guy it was so easy to get along with and talk to and be completely normal/stupid with. Truly makes me happy every day I see him.\nI&amp;#39;m just really thankful for all of my friends and I wish everyone knew what it was like to find their best friend soul mate as we like to call ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I&amp;#39;m really happy to have the friends that I have! :D&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "So I've seen a lot of people talk about how they have never had a best friend and it makes me realize just how freaking lucky I am and that I shouldn't take my relationships for granted.\nMy closest/best friend has been there for me since 1st grade.
