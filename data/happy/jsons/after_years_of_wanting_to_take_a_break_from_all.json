Currently, I'm 6 or 8 months in. There are pros &amp; cons. I fast from other things too, e.g., meat, food, television, sugar, dairy, sodas, phone notifications and sometimes, electronics, altogether. \n\nHere's what I learned that I hope will benefit you: It's not what goes IN your mind/body that's problematic, it's how you react to it that's important. Fasting is simply self-imposed awareness; it provides an opportunity to look at yourself and say, \"WOW! It's spooky how conditioned I had become, to think I 'NEEDED' that!\" The trick is to actually learn from it. Let it be entertaining, even funny, as you witness yourself reaching for your phone, whenever you have a thought to express or feel tempted to go out of your way to take/share a photo...which would only be a forgettable, if not completely unrecognized, blip of attention in the lives of others. Remain interested in YOUR behavior. I find it helpful to think of it as an \"experiment\", to not deprecate the usefulness of anything...and social media CAN be extremely useful. I say again, as you keep your focus OFF of social media's blemishes, and ON what you'll learn and do with that extra time and energy. Smile at yourself, when you see that the icon for the app is no longer on your phone. When you want to say or share something with someone, do it. Make it meaningful. Get creative about communicating again. Pay attention to the decrease in \"bad news\" from your life...because, people LOVE to complain and commiserate...if they had to call or email you, they're more likely to keep it to themselves - making life MUCH better for you. BUT! It's not FB that's been hurting you...it's not even friends or family. Taking a break (as you called it), can be much, much more than simply abstaining from the consequences, if you let it - it can be an opportunity to learn and work through the REAL issues.\n\nAfter a fast, when I introduce things like ice-cream or alcohol back into my diet, I always feel a little guilty...like I'm contaminating myself a little bit...which I am. My point - the illusion is that the ice-cream or alcohol is the naughty/harmful thing...it's not...the naughty/harmful thing is using them responsibly. Responsibility is a by-product of REALLY understanding dynamics, limitations and consequences. If I hadn't fasted from these things, I would be less aware of my own limits, weaknesses and strengths. As those things are revealed, are liberated! There are 6 pints of ice-cream in my freezer right now - it's ok - if I want some, I'll have a bite or two. It was a fast that helped me to realize that a bite or two was all I ever really wanted...not the whole pint! I don't feel guilty to have a beer, whenever the heck I want. I've been known to have a beer with pancakes at breakfast. No, it's not \"normal\" it's not \"socially acceptable\", but I have learned to care less about what it \"looks like\" to other people. I am familiar and confident of the real consequences...or lack thereof. That confidence comes from what I learned during a fast.\n\nAs you experience those little moments of \"Facebook withdrawal\", make an effort to contemplate your levels of stress and anxiety. Get familiar with it. I suspect that you'll discover that your social media accounts weren't causing your S/A, they were just muddying up the waters. As you deny your social media habits, and deal with the social consequences of not being just like everyone else, you'll gain a new kind of confidence. You'll trust yourself just a little bit more. You'll respect yourself more for the progress you've made. You'll feel just a little more empowered to make/break whichever habits you set your mind to. When you feel a little more like THAT...your stress and anxiety will won't be painful anymore. They'll return to their natural places - tools to help you; signals to activate you.\n\nTLDR - people who proactively explore their weaknesses, in an effort to improve their own lives, end up fixing things they never thought were broken.\n\nI realize this is a lot to write about a decision that seems so trivial to some people.
