We&amp;#39;ll call her A. We started talking and really hit it off, found out we liked a lot of the same things and had similar views, but just different enough to keep things interesting. A lives a few states away from me, about a 6.5 hour drive. We started getting more intimate, with Skype calls and things like that, and we both really started falling for each other and using &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot;s and everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Couple months pass, all is well, and we&amp;#39;re talking about meeting up in real life. Both of us are enthusiastic about it, can&amp;#39;t wait, etc. About a month ago after my birthday, A started getting a little distant. This worried me, of course, so I tried talking to her about it. Turns out there&amp;#39;s a guy she re-met (call him T). I say re-met because he moved away when they were acquaintances and then moved back. They started hanging out a lot, which I thought was great because A has some social anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So a few weeks pass, all seems well, but one night A messages me on kik and we talk for a little while. As it turns out, her feelings for me have dwindled somewhat and T has been expressing serious interest even though he knows that I&amp;#39;m in the picture (sort of). I thought about it for a while, and today I let A know that if she prefers T over me, I get it and that she should go for it. I understand how hard it is to be in a relationship with someone you can&amp;#39;t even touch. So she said okay, and that was it, basically. I was debating whether I should even post this in this subreddit, but I think it fits. I&amp;#39;m happy for her. I&amp;#39;m happy that A finally has someone she can be with in the physical sense. Yeah, it&amp;#39;s shitty for me, but I&amp;#39;ll be fine. Glass half full and all that. Sorry for the rant, just had to get that out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Phew.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "For the past few months (5+) I've been talking to this girl I met online.
