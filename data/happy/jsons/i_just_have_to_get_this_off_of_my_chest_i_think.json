I AM SO HAPPY. I am just scared because the one exam I believe is a bit borderline in terms of mark, but I calculated it out, I just needed to get a 40% to pass, which I think I obtained (oh, low self confidence at its best). The other class I had a 95% (HOLY CRAP, RIGHT?) which I&amp;#39;ve never gotten in my life, and the exam was worth 40% of my mark, so I think I have that one covered even if I get a zero.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My significant other and I put an offer on a house last night, I haven&amp;#39;t heard back from the real estate agent yet, but I think the family had until 10pm to give an answer, so I&amp;#39;ll know by tonight if we get the house or not, it&amp;#39;s SO EXCITING.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t got a job lined up yet, but I am currently working on that. I have my current job until the end of the month, so I&amp;#39;ll be looking like crazy. I&amp;#39;ve offered to volunteer at a place and once my contract is up I was going to volunteer full time but the director said that he wouldn&amp;#39;t let me volunteer for free full time, so I hope that turns into something for me because I would LOVE to work there. It&amp;#39;d be so much fun...!!! I also have a script writing opportunity as well coming up, just waiting for more details on that in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AH the possibilities... I am just rolling in the positivity right now! I&amp;#39;ve never been as happy as I am right now in this moment... I hope all goes well! :D &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ALSO, my kitty had a surgery to get 15 teeth removed in total because he was not eating for 3-4 days at a time and I had to bring him into the vet every week to get pain meds and more teeth removed. It costs a fair amount but I am sooo happy my kitty is eating with no pain. The amount of money was relatively small compared to what I would have paid elsewhere in town. I go to a vet 30 minutes outside of my city because I used to live there and loved the place before. I am so glad to still have my kitty! &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s to hoping for the best!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "SO, I literally just finished my last exam for the final courses of my degree!!
