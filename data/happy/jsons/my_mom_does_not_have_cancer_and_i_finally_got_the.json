SHE DOES NOT HAVE CANCER! A big relief for my mom, my dad, and my whole family. My grandfather was so happy that he broke down on the phone after he heard of the report. We had been gearing for the worst, especially after the Oncologist was straight up about it (he saw CT-scans and PET-scans and said it is definitely lymphoma) being LYMPHOMA, but he said we need to wait for the biopsy to see what kind it is. But the report cleared everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It finally happened yesterday. I was flown into this city day before yesterday. I spent a lot of time researching about this job and the interview process, and a lot of money getting ready for it (suit, hotel, etc.. They paid for the flight). I already work for the company, but I have no experience for this job, just the self belief that I can do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had the backing of all my current supervisors, but some of my co-workers were not so supportive. These positions are very competitive, only 1600 needed for a 100,000+ applicants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were about 60~70 of us in the session, and the number of people they choose per session depends entirely upon them (I&amp;#39;ve heard they can choose anywhere from 4 people up to 15, and sometimes none). I was most worried about the face-to-face interview part of the session (2 people ask you a series of questions in a closed room, expecting answers in the STAR format, and noting down everything), but for some divine reason I was placed in a group which had their f2f interviews first. Nervous as a dude who just had his bride runaway on him on wedding day, I went about answering questions they put forward to the best of abilities. The whole process was about 30 minutes. After that, our group was sent to two other activities. All our movements, our actions, our interactions were closely monitored by HR people, and everything we did in that building was being judged upon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it helps, I went in to interview with the qualification of speaking a specific language (there were around 6 of us who spoke this language, 3 of us got selected, but I found out that only 1 speak/READ/WRITE this language, the other 2 still get to keep this job though).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the whole process was over, one of the ladies in charge came up to me (who I talked to as soon as I walked into the building) came up to me and said she saw my report, and I did very well and that the interviewers were very impressed by me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They funneled all of us into a room, and made an excuse to keep 14 people behind, while telling others to leave and that they will be contacted. I was one of the people asked to stay behind. Once everyone else left, we were told to take out our passports and get them ready because we&amp;#39;ll be traveling a lot (one of the reasons I wanted this job, both domestic and international), BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN SELECTED!!!! This was one of the happiest days of my life (not as good as the report on Wednesday though).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After we came out of the room, we were welcomed by all the 30+ people who were responsible for the selection process (people already doing the job + HR people). The 2 people who did my f2f interview found me and said they were very impressed by my interview, and immediately recommended me for the job, even before the rest of the process was done. I couldn&amp;#39;t be happier after hearing this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am especially surprised because there were a lot of people there WITH PAST EXPERIENCE (some of them with this very company, carrying 10+ years earlier on in their lives). To have been chosen over them means a great deal to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure already working for the company, speaking a foreign language (I speak a total of 4 languages), and getting some amazing letters of recommendation from my supervisors helped a lot, but I&amp;#39;m still trying to get a hang of the fact that I got selected over so many people and people who&amp;#39;ve had past experience doing this job WITH THE VERY COMPANY (I repeat, I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE IN THIS JOB!). I am thankful to everyone who helped me along the way, but I want to thank my best friend (who works with me at my old position, but in a different department) who HELPED ME A LOT, more than anyone else, and always believing in me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did have fun after I got the job. Called my dad, mom and my friend, and this is how the conversation went -&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi. I&amp;#39;m done with the interview. There were 60~70 of us. It took the whole day. I had a very hard interview process. They only selected 14. I&amp;#39;m at the airport now, about to get on the flight back home. I&amp;#39;ll see you soon. By the way, I got the job.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I have a month before I move to this new city, train for 2 months, then start working.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also, it boosted my self-confidence many folds after around 5 ladies who were part of the interview process (who I&amp;#39;ve never met) came up to me and told me I was looking very sharp and handsome in my suit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These two events could be the best birthday gift I could have asked for.
