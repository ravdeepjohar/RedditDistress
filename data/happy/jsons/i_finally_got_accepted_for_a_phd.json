The human aspect and politics shocked me as well, since I expected something like the traditional \"ivory tower\". Scientists are human beings, working with the same knowledge base available to everyone else, and they make the same mistakes when it comes to overselling their results and blacklisting competitors, regardless of scientific merit. It's ugly, and you're about to see the proverbial sausage being made. \n  \n* **You won't learn much.** You've likely already learned all of the fundamentals from a B.S. in your field, and the next few years will be spent slowly, laboriously, boringly hashing out particulars. Undergraduate studies have a lot of hard, interesting work with problem sets and new ideas, and the average day of an undergrad involves a lot of theory-laden mind-expansion. A grad student spends most of their time struggling with the literature, their research, or the *stupid god damn undergrads* who waste their office hours asking questions instead of letting the TA's red pen do its work.  \n* **Relax.** It's not a race. Take the time to pick a research question you find genuinely interesting, and don't over-commit to a lab or a project early on. Grades matter less than they did as an undergrad (but try to stay above a B-, since many grad programs count a C as a failing grade.) It's very unlikely someone will beat you to the punch on your research, and if you read the literature, you'll know who to watch out for anyway - so do your work correctly and carefully, rather than rushing to produce a publication or result.  \n* **Read a paper every day.** Every single day. I do it when I get to work, or on my morning train commute. It will keep you up to date with the field, and get your brain in the mood for work. Otherwise, you'll probably end up on reddit all day. However, that brings me to my next point:  \n* **Being a grad student is not like a job.** You won't have deadlines, or deliverables, or objectives except the ones you set for yourself (with your advisor's input, hopefully.) It's very easy to do nothing all day, and nobody will say anything about it. In fact, your colleagues may goof off a lot too. You're still there to get things done, in the long run. As a grad student the major skill you will develop during your career, and the one that sets you apart from industry-going friends, is your ability to self-motivate and work effectively at your own pace.  \n* **It's very easy to get depressed as a grad student.** Part of that is due to the lack of direction and sparsity of tangible, regular results. It's also just a poor source of income, and you will be socially isolated from many peers by your specialization and perceived (or real) \"intellectualism\". Make sure you take advantage of university psychological services and psychiatric care. It may sound like overkill now, but trust me - around the time you have to take your qual, or when you're in the 4th-year slog, you will need some support.  \n  \nThat's enough of a wall of text for now!

A grad student spends most of their time struggling with the literature, their research, or the &lt;em&gt;stupid god damn undergrads&lt;/em&gt; who waste their office hours asking questions instead of letting the TA&amp;#39;s red pen do its work.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relax.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s not a race. Take the time to pick a research question you find genuinely interesting, and don&amp;#39;t over-commit to a lab or a project early on. Grades matter less than they did as an undergrad (but try to stay above a B-, since many grad programs count a C as a failing grade.) It&amp;#39;s very unlikely someone will beat you to the punch on your research, and if you read the literature, you&amp;#39;ll know who to watch out for anyway - so do your work correctly and carefully, rather than rushing to produce a publication or result.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read a paper every day.&lt;/strong&gt; Every single day. I do it when I get to work, or on my morning train commute. It will keep you up to date with the field, and get your brain in the mood for work. Otherwise, you&amp;#39;ll probably end up on reddit all day. However, that brings me to my next point:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being a grad student is not like a job.&lt;/strong&gt; You won&amp;#39;t have deadlines, or deliverables, or objectives except the ones you set for yourself (with your advisor&amp;#39;s input, hopefully.) It&amp;#39;s very easy to do nothing all day, and nobody will say anything about it. In fact, your colleagues may goof off a lot too. You&amp;#39;re still there to get things done, in the long run. As a grad student the major skill you will develop during your career, and the one that sets you apart from industry-going friends, is your ability to self-motivate and work effectively at your own pace.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#39;s very easy to get depressed as a grad student.&lt;/strong&gt; Part of that is due to the lack of direction and sparsity of tangible, regular results. It&amp;#39;s also just a poor source of income, and you will be socially isolated from many peers by your specialization and perceived (or real) &amp;quot;intellectualism&amp;quot;. Make sure you take advantage of university psychological services and psychiatric care. It may sound like overkill now, but trust me - around the time you have to take your qual, or when you&amp;#39;re in the 4th-year slog, you will need some support.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s enough of a wall of text for now!
