As someone who is in the process of getting clean, himself, I really appreciate the agony and the ecstasy that come with fighting for sobriety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I beat heroin (though only by way of a maintenance program) and am now trying to kick my addiction to pot. In the last few months I&amp;#39;ve gone down from smoking 3-4 times a day, to smoking 3-4 times a month.  Gonna make it there eventually.  So my thanks to you: you&amp;#39;re an inspiration to me, and to everyone else who&amp;#39;s living with addiction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s hoping we&amp;#39;ll be hearing from you again in another 150 days.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_1y9nvq", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cfj6quj", "created": 1392817401.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1392817401.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 1}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh5i", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "happy", "likes": null, "replies": "", "saved": false, "id": "cfj9qgu", "gilded": 0, "author": "RufusLongfellow", "parent_id": "t3_1y9nvq", "approved_by": null, "body": "I'm proud of you man!
