My depression and anxiety started a long time ago, though Ive generally always been high functioning. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just over a year ago I was working for a small company with an awesome boss, but I wasnt moving up fast enough to be content and the only other person in my life at the time, my girlfriend of 8 years, was totally complacent in life. I would leave for work, bust my ass, get home and she would still be in the same chair as when I left, the house still a mess. I was also financially supporting her so I was still living paycheck to paycheck. \nAs time wore on I started asking myself, why am I doing this? I work so hard to come home to this? This is what my time is buying me? Is this just it for 30 years until I die? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, Id lost the ability to know what a fufilling life can be. All the richness was gone for me. I slowly started taking more and more risks everyday, talking about suicide with my girlfriend and drinking/taking pills in excess. One night  Id decided enough was enough and I took a severe overdose of my prescription medication.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three days later I woke up in the hospital and the first thing I remember was the look on my fathers face.

Everyday I do things I love and I wont take no for an answer. I expell toxic people from my life and form loving, meaningful relationships everyday.
