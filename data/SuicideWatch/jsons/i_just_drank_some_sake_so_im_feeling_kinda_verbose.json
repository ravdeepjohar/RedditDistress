I catch myself saying the latter quite alot, and have visions of me just walking out into the ocean, or the forest and just disappearing. Ive never really planned anything out besides maybe wanting to OD on sleeping pills, or carbon monoxide poisoning. But something like shooting myself in the head, or cuting myself, just scare me because I feel it can fail, and id have to live through that.

Im just.. physically lonely.All my life ive experienced people that ive allowed to get close to me to backstab me and leave me behind. It started when I was 10 with family, to recently with my best friend of over 10 years. I have no hope in churches because that is where the biggest event happened. Where a group of people decided to lie about me just to take my place on the music ministry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I deal with these thoughts that im worthless, and that all im good for is to be used. I think quite alot, that no one will miss me.And that no one will notice for a very long time that im gone. Ive gone as far as to delete social media to prove it to myself, and sadly I have.  All these people who claim to be my friends, and get angry when i dont talk to them, yet never answer. Delete a facebook, and you never hear from them again. I honestly wont be missed. All anyone has ever told me from the people closest to my enemies is that im bad.  I always give of myself, my money, my time for people i care about in need, but always I end up being the bad guy. This drove me to antidepressants which eventually i stopped taking because they made me worse.. and without them.. I feel way worse than before.. being in dark places more often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wish I had a special someone in my life.. sort of like a foundation. Someone who would pledge to love me unconditionally. Im 25, and feel depressed that I dont even have a relationship, and all my friends from high school are either married or have kids.  I just want to be loved.. by someone. Anyone. To feel like.. I matter. To make matters worse.. the only women that I seem to attract, and worse, find myself attached to are two women who are in marraiges where one husband has cheated, and the other is abusive. I get told all their issues, and told how much of a great person I am. One of them flirts with me online, and we have even done some roleplay stuff and picture sharing.. the other one tells me im the most favorite person in the world, calls me all these pet names, and tells me she loves me. We even have pet nicknames for eachother. Pathetically, im attracted to both of them ( and they are gorgeous, women who would never notice me) and think all day about them, and sometimes hope that one of them would leave their husband for me.. but thatll never happen. All this to say, It makes me feel pathetic.. that I cant find someone perfect for me.. but the type of girl Ive always wanted, ends up being married and not available but so on and so forth.  I also spend time, and money on stupid cam girls because they make me feel wanted although I know its fake.. and i end up being broke because of this. I just feel really pathetic..and like im losing it.. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of me knows the answers.. or some.. yet.. I cant.. im stuck.. I hate myself.. and hate my life..
