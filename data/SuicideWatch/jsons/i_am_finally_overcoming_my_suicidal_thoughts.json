He didn&amp;#39;t really respond much more than some &amp;quot;aww&amp;quot; and a few &amp;quot;ah&amp;quot;, so I got angry and more depressed.

Knife in one hand, phone on mute in front of me. Thinking about if I should slit my wrists or hang myself.

I was surprised like hell and happy and angry and sad and so much was going through me. I sat against the wall, crying and talking. We stayed on the phone until he got here and then he ran into me, hugged me tighter than somebody probably will ever hold me and started crying. He told me to never do it again, how afraid he was to lose me and how happy to see me alive and okay. I couldn&amp;#39;t do anything but just say &amp;quot;Sorry&amp;quot; multiple times and holding him, letting him cry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We talked, cried and laughed together, he told me that there actually is hope for me and much more things. I thank him from the bottom of my heart for being there for me. If he didn&amp;#39;t care so much about me, I would have been gone right now.
