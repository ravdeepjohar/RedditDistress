I had friends only in it,  I had no knowledge of reality, despite living in it I was basically under a rock. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was 12 I left, everything felt hopeless after that, my friends from the cult ignored me, my two friends at school wouldn&amp;#39;t care because they were young, even I felt that it wasn&amp;#39;t anything worth being sad about, and I was just being silly. \nMy parents didn&amp;#39;t think much about me or my sisters impact on this was, because they thought it wasn&amp;#39;t much. \nBut I didn&amp;#39;t know about any holidays other than religious ones, or any music other than music ones.

He sent us both letters, mine was friend like.

I&amp;#39;m not even sure why I am, I have no reason, other than maybe the constant abandonment of friends, which is worse because I get so easily attached. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now whenever I tell someone they just tell me to shut up because I have a better life than them, and it&amp;#39;s my fault. \nI feel worthless, my only friends are the ones I created. \nI need a hug, I am seriously considering suicide. \nI don&amp;#39;t want to, but somehow my mind is drawn to the idea, I want to do it.
