I understand the feeling of being completely alone, I think sometimes it's underrated from other people. I was in the same situation as you for a long time, so I can relate.\n\nRegarding the place: I read that you moving isn't an option. So, do you live next to a bigger city? What about you go to the neighbouring city either with some friends or on your own? Maybe go to a night club or a bar there? Or if the neighbouring city is too far or it's too expensive to get there, then try again at the night clubs where you live.\n\nI know what you mean, it's not like the movies, you don't just walk up to the first person at a bar and say hello and your eyes meet and fall madly in love and are happily married in a year. That's true, but still that doesn't mean that *nothing* can happen. It's completely fine to walk up to someone and start a conversation, you can make it about something specific you just noticed about the person, for example a book she's reading, or a drink she just ordered, or a comment she just gave. That can lead up to a conversation really quickly. I know you say everyone sticks to their friends. How about you try going out on your own, and try approaching someone who is also on their own. You say you can't do it because you know your motives are going to be obvious, that's not *completely* true. The girl doesn't know if you're just seeking a one night stand, a relationship, or a friendship, or maybe nothing at all, just a nice conversation and company for the rest of the night. When you approach a girl, you are sending the signal \"I find you interesting\". No one gets offended by such a signal :)\n\nI am going to tell you a bit about my experience if you don't mind. I recently moved to a new country. A completely different continent, different language and all. And guess what, I moved completely alone. I felt completely lonely at the beginning (Still do sometimes) and I desperately wanted to meet new people. I sat in bars and restaurants alone, waiting for someone to come up and talk to me. Nothing really happened. Then I thought \"If I'm not doing anything, I can't really expect anything to happen\". I am a fairly quite person around strangers. And it was completely new to me trying to talk to someone just like that. It took me a bit of courage, but I started making some small talks when I'm in the train for example. Sometimes it would develop into a conversation, other times there would be a reply to my comment and that's it. But I thought, well, maybe next time.\n\nLet me tell you, as soon as I made it a bit normal for me to just talk to strangers, it felt somehow better, I knew that I can just find some sort of a reason to strike a conversation with someone, and this person could be the person to be my friend or more. If not, it can be frustrating but I'm not losing anything. The the next person might be a success. \n\nI'm really sorry that you are feeling like that, but it's not going to get better faster if you don't try to address the problem directly. I know it's all easier said than done, and it's not going to happen immediately either. But not all hope is lost like you think, believe me! I know it's frustrating hearing your friends always saying \"you will meet someone\" It's easy for them to say that when they have someone already. People tend to forget how it felt before having that person.\n\nBut as I said I really believe that it will make a difference when you break that limit of talking to strangers. And maybe also if possible going out in a different city. Try going out on your own, because then you won't be bound to the people you're with. If it doesn't work the first times, that doesn't mean it won't at all, please try and keep that in mind. \n\nAnd about you being no one's favourite in the world. I am sorry you are feeling like that, but what makes you so sure. You don't have to be someone's boyfriend in order to be someone's favourite. \n\nI really hope all of this doesn't sound like a broken record. Think about it. Weigh your options again.
