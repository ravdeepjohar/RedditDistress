If there is some sort of a higher being I have to answer to, I can at least say I tried to help someone else before I shot myself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing I keep hearing about is how suicide is a selfish act. I&amp;#39;m single, no kids, just my mom and dad who are divorced and my sister. No one really to leave behind. My dad is remarried, my mom is probably going to find another asshole to emotionally abuse her, and my sister is a writing major. Maybe this will give my sister an exclusive story or inspiration for a best selling book, because I know she probably won&amp;#39;t find anything else worthwhile in that field. I&amp;#39;m sick with alcoholism thanks to my dad, (Yes I tried al-anon/alateen, yes I tried AA, yes I saw a shrink last month, yes I told her I have suicidal thoughts and no, nothing she told me helped. I even tried volunteering at the nearby cancer hospital in hopes of replacing my desire to drink with some altruism. Didn&amp;#39;t work.) I also have dysthymia, and I&amp;#39;m just not someone who should ever reproduce. I have abused former girlfriends just like my dad emotionally abused my mom, and it&amp;#39;s just a part of me. I owe it to my mom to give her a kick ass Mother&amp;#39;s Day with how much my dad shit on her and how much crap I have put her through growing up, so I guess that will be my final adieu to my mom and sister. I just hate the alcoholic, the abuser, and the asshole part of who I am and I do not want to turn in to my dad or have fucked up kids with my disorder(s) or my alcoholism. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really would like my organs to go to someone though. I&amp;#39;m at an age where my heart may still be of use (25) as well as my kidneys, &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; my liver, as well as intestines. I read the website where you go to register, and it states: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Importantly, most people don\u2019t die in a way that makes them eligible for organ/tissue donation\u2026but we hope everyone registers, just in case. If a person dies in a way that does not allow for donation, then the family would need to contact the funeral home or willed body program to have the body transported there.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So SW, does shooting yourself in the head make you eligible? Do I need to fill my tub up full of ice and do it there? Will that lower my body temperature enough? Or do I need to die in another manner inline with their requirements? Would anyone happen to know what those are for a deceased organ donor? I also have had high blood pressure for the past 3 years, would that also affect me being able to donate organs? And, would donating double red blood cells affect organ donation? I&amp;#39;ve heard your body replenishes the blood within hours of donating, but the time to stabilize your body chemistry is fucked up for a few weeks. If this is true, I guess I&amp;#39;ll have to wait longer. I&amp;#39;m kind of young and up until last year was somewhat physically active. I&amp;#39;m probably going to end up wrapping my lips around the muzzle that is pointed towards the back of my head in hopes of severing the brain stem with 00 buck. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If suicide does in fact rule out organ donation, I suppose I will have to get clever. I really don&amp;#39;t want to have to have a police officer do it, I&amp;#39;m afraid of falling from heights, I drive a pretty heavy and somewhat safe car, and I don&amp;#39;t know if people will buy me accidentally overdosing. I guess there is always drowning, but I don&amp;#39;t know if I will get to the hospital in time, if drowning in a chlorine pool affects my organ donation, or what. Too many factors come into play.

You have saved so many lifes with your blood. You don\u2019t realize it, but you are doing already a great service to humanity. You saved lives. Do you realize that? You diminish your own value by thinking that such blood went to help thugs.\n\nyea. blood. only by chance do i have that blood type, not by choice can i help people like that. And with how many units I have given in the past six years, I'd wager at least one of them was a detriment to society who didn't deserve it. \n\n&gt;I don\u2019t understand one thing: why are you basically thinking of yourself as a slave of your own nature? You could have the willpower to change it, if only you wanted. Do you think changing yourself is easy? You are totally wrong. People think they can change the world, but they can\u2019t change even themselves. So\u2026 you wanna change? You will have to act on it.\n\nYes, I sure would have to act on it. Act on changing 19 years of upbringing and nurture. How about this, I suck start a twelve gauge. \n\n&gt;And this one is exactly the thing I was talking about; The first set of impressions you're likely to face are variations on \"I can't\". You'll have the thought that you can't quit, aren't able to quit. Well, treat this rationally, philosophically, empirically. Where is the evidence that you can't? Other people have before. How can you predict the future like that? You don't know with certainty what you will accomplish in the future; there is no real evidence about the future. A similar kind of impression is variations on \"It's my nature\". The kind of thoughts that say your 'essence' is addicted. I call these trait theories. Thoughts like, \"I am too weak to quit\", \"Other people can quit because they are strong and disciplined and noble, but I'm no good; I'm not as strong as them\", \"I have an addictive personality\", \"It's genetic\", or \"It's just how I am\". Well, let's look at this rationally: where is the evidence for your 'essence'? No one has ever seen a human essence; they've seen human behaviours. Behave as someone who is not addicted and you're not an addict; that is correct use of impressions. Everything is impermanent, as Marcus Aurelius says in Meditations 4:3 \u201cEverything you see will soon alter and cease to exist. Think of how many changes you've already seen. The world is nothing but change.\u201d So, in a world where nothing stays the same for even one second, who says you can't change?\n\nI know I can't. I can tell you I was something a long time ago. I was something for my parents to brag about. I could play a musical instrument. I was in the Air Force. I could play a decent game of tennis. I helped some of my friends get through financial hardships on my own dime, particularly because I was a young fool. I dated some of the smartest girls in my school.

Two years of self destructive behavior, a failed relationship, and countless half assed attempts at sobriety, dropping out of school, sometimes I have to wonder if it's all just me or if there is some recurring family habits here that I might be more prone to making. And yes, damn right there are about to be some changes. \"Everything you see will soon alter and cease to exist.\" Couldn't agree more. There have definitely been some changes in my life. For better and for worse. Except this time, I'm just going to \"change\" my life span from maybe being 70 something into 25. I'd say that's a a pretty big change.

You diminish your own value by thinking that such blood went to help thugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;yea. blood. only by chance do i have that blood type, not by choice can i help people like that. And with how many units I have given in the past six years, I&amp;#39;d wager at least one of them was a detriment to society who didn&amp;#39;t deserve it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t understand one thing: why are you basically thinking of yourself as a slave of your own nature? You could have the willpower to change it, if only you wanted. Do you think changing yourself is easy? You are totally wrong. People think they can change the world, but they can\u2019t change even themselves. So\u2026 you wanna change? You will have to act on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, I sure would have to act on it. Act on changing 19 years of upbringing and nurture. How about this, I suck start a twelve gauge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And this one is exactly the thing I was talking about; The first set of impressions you&amp;#39;re likely to face are variations on &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t&amp;quot;. You&amp;#39;ll have the thought that you can&amp;#39;t quit, aren&amp;#39;t able to quit. Well, treat this rationally, philosophically, empirically. Where is the evidence that you can&amp;#39;t? Other people have before. How can you predict the future like that? You don&amp;#39;t know with certainty what you will accomplish in the future; there is no real evidence about the future. A similar kind of impression is variations on &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s my nature&amp;quot;. The kind of thoughts that say your &amp;#39;essence&amp;#39; is addicted. I call these trait theories. Thoughts like, &amp;quot;I am too weak to quit&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Other people can quit because they are strong and disciplined and noble, but I&amp;#39;m no good; I&amp;#39;m not as strong as them&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I have an addictive personality&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s genetic&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s just how I am&amp;quot;. Well, let&amp;#39;s look at this rationally: where is the evidence for your &amp;#39;essence&amp;#39;? No one has ever seen a human essence; they&amp;#39;ve seen human behaviours. Behave as someone who is not addicted and you&amp;#39;re not an addict; that is correct use of impressions. Everything is impermanent, as Marcus Aurelius says in Meditations 4:3 \u201cEverything you see will soon alter and cease to exist. Think of how many changes you&amp;#39;ve already seen. The world is nothing but change.\u201d So, in a world where nothing stays the same for even one second, who says you can&amp;#39;t change?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I can&amp;#39;t. I can tell you I was something a long time ago. I was something for my parents to brag about. I could play a musical instrument. I was in the Air Force. I could play a decent game of tennis. I helped some of my friends get through financial hardships on my own dime, particularly because I was a young fool. I dated some of the smartest girls in my school. One of whom went on to become a lawyer. Two years of self destructive behavior, a failed relationship, and countless half assed attempts at sobriety, dropping out of school, sometimes I have to wonder if it&amp;#39;s all just me or if there is some recurring family habits here that I might be more prone to making. And yes, damn right there are about to be some changes. &amp;quot;Everything you see will soon alter and cease to exist.&amp;quot; Couldn&amp;#39;t agree more. There have definitely been some changes in my life. For better and for worse. Except this time, I&amp;#39;m just going to &amp;quot;change&amp;quot; my life span from maybe being 70 something into 25. I&amp;#39;d say that&amp;#39;s a a pretty big change. And I&amp;#39;d say soon after that &amp;quot;change&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;d cease to exist. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_245wc0", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ch40xxx", "created": 1398684348.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1398680748.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 4}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "saved": false, "id": "ch40en6", "gilded": 0, "author": "Nemesis1992", "parent_id": "t3_245wc0", "approved_by": null, "body": "hi throwaway24560000, nice to meet you. \nI read everything you have written. So, let's start:\n&gt; One thing I keep hearing about is how suicide is a selfish act. I'm single, no kids, just my mom and dad who are divorced and my sister. No one really to leave behind.\n\nLet's think rationally, shall we?\nSuicide is a selfish act. But not in the way people intend it. You have 25 years old and you are thinking about suicide. If there is one thing certain out there, well, it is death.\nAnd if people call you selfish for thinking about suicide, it shouldn't be because you have to be living for other people out. But it is, because by committing suicide, you are basically removing yourself many opportunities:\n- The opportunity to be happy\n- The opportunity to have kids\n- The opportunity to help people\n- The opportunity for a new beginning.\n[...]\nAnd the list could go on for quite a while, to be sincere.  Life surprises people. If I had chosen the path you are currently taking, when I was 18, I would missing out things like meeting new great people, enjoying my current life that I wouldn\u2019t have even dreamed of,  giving love to people that deserve love and so on.\n\n&gt; It's all over rated. Everything about being a good person is over rated and under appreciated. \n\nI don't think so. The difference between good people and bad people, is that the first are able to make people happy, while the second are able to make people sad.  Would you call that over-rated?\nBy the way, I read that you think that people over-extended with you because you were too kind. I do think that being kind is a great quality, to be sincere, and so I do not neglect you for being kind.\nWhat I want to suggest you, is to give trust to people, but this trust should be built upon time. You can\u2019t hope to lend favors away like a bank, because you\u2019ll likely attract leeches. \n\n&gt; And it certainly isn't valued. Especially not by women. \n\nOn that regard I may say that you could be right, but it depends certainly on the women you have found.\nIt is not black and white as you think. \n\n&gt; No. I'm not needed. I don't wake up in the morning with missed calls saying how much the world needs me. The only thing worthy I have to realistically offer this world is my fucking blood. A bunch of red blood cells with 0 antibodies. That is my worth to people.\n\nDo you think that is a \u201clittle\u201d worth? You have saved so many lifes with your blood. You don\u2019t realize it, but you are doing already a great service to humanity. You saved lives. Do you realize that? You diminish your own value by thinking that such blood went to help thugs. \n\n\n&gt; Then what exactly is my worth here if I am not going to reproduce? I know I don't like living alone, and I know I am at risk to abusing an SO. So even then, I'd still rather not subject that person to any predisposition I may have.\n\nI don\u2019t understand one thing: why are you basically thinking of yourself as a slave of your own nature? You could have the willpower to change it, if only you wanted. Do you think changing yourself is easy? You are totally wrong. People think they can change the world, but they can\u2019t change even themselves.\nSo\u2026 you wanna change? You will have to act on it.\n\n&gt; I'm sick with alcoholism thanks to my dad.\n\nAnd this one is exactly the thing I was talking about;\nThe first set of impressions you're likely to face are variations on \"I can't\". You'll have the thought that you can't quit, aren't able to quit. Well, treat this rationally, philosophically, empirically. Where is the evidence that you can't? Other people have before. How can you predict the future like that? You don't know with certainty what you will accomplish in the future; there is no real evidence about the future.\nA similar kind of impression is variations on \"It's my nature\". The kind of thoughts that say your 'essence' is addicted. I call these trait theories. Thoughts like, \"I am too weak to quit\", \"Other people can quit because they are strong and disciplined and noble, but I'm no good; I'm not as strong as them\", \"I have an addictive personality\", \"It's genetic\", or \"It's just how I am\".

The world is nothing but change.\u201d So, in a world where nothing stays the same for even one second, who says you can't change?\n\nA fifth class of false impressions is \"It's too hard\". Look at this rationally: sure it's hard, it's difficult, it's uncomfortable. But \"too\" hard implies a standard. There's a philosophy there of: \"The world may be this hard, but if it's any harder, then the world sucks, it's no good. It's reality's fault for being harder than I have decided it should be.\" Here again you're focusing on what you can't control, whining and demanding that things be one way, when they indubitably are the other way.
