I have been thinking of suicide for quite some time. i thought it was just thoughts in my head until they became real today.  The positives in my life in one class away from an AA is psychology and am in the process of transffering jobs from one UPS hub (Orange County) and another, Las Vegas. i have been with the company for 6 years.  Every day i wake up i have this gut renching feeling of going to work and interacting with the assholes that infest the place. I make good money on salary as a part timer with benefits and thats what keeps me there.  Every day no matter how well you did the previous day is a new push for higher numbers or M.A.R. (quota).  im a supervisor there and deal with peoples bullshit everyday weather it be calling in (not showing up, meaning i have to load the route, which i have no urge to do but i do it anyways) or their personal issues &amp;quot; i have to leave early to take X somewhere let me leave early&amp;quot; and may the heavens help you if you say no.

I should also add i work in the early mornings and waking up at 2am m-f is taking its toll mentally which is parcially responsible for bringing my brain to this point.   I smoke weed 3-5 times a week and drink at least 5-6 times a week. I get hammered by myself about twice a week. (been going on for about 6 months now, right before the Christmas rush until now).   I am currently set up to transfer to Vegas hub to continue schooling at UNLV (its been 3 weeks and i havent heard from them and that is also adding to the stress).  Every day these suicidal thoughts get more real and real. I used to think of them as fantasy but now i has almost become reality as i sit in this car.   I am 24 going on 25 still living at home. My mother and father both are apart of the AA program, im not due to my belief in &amp;quot;God&amp;quot; sorry if that offends anyone but thats just how i feel.   In the book of AA there is a chapter to the Agnostics and here is one of my favorite comedians Doug Stanhope routine which i love and sums up my feelings in AA  ( here is a link to it &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4txNz25Ht9o\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4txNz25Ht9o&lt;/a&gt; )   I just listened to it and still gave me a rare smile.
