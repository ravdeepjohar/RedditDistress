Welll....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 First of all I used to identify as genderqueer and gender fluid, and according to this one biologist from &lt;a href=\"/r/TumblrInAction\"&gt;/r/TumblrInAction&lt;/a&gt;, the brain can only be male, female, or somewhere in between; the gender can&amp;#39;t change because white-to-gray matter ratios don&amp;#39;t change. Now I feel like a transtrender, because I&amp;#39;d been having doubts that I was trans since I&amp;#39;ve been feeling slightly more female than male lately, and as a kid I was more girly, then tomboyish, then in between, then more girly from like 5-10th grade. But I do experience gender dysphoria of some sort (I hate the way people expect me to act as a woman, like because I have a feminine face people expect me to wear dresses and have long hair like I used to, saying &amp;quot;ohhh you looked pretty you looked pretty!&amp;quot; and every time I heard the word pretty I felt as though I would vomit), and I sometimes wish I had a penis. I also hate the shit out of gender roles... but that&amp;#39;s another story. My mom also thinks trans men are gender traitors and said it was disgusting that I wanted to look masculine. (I&amp;#39;m still a feminist regardless of my gender so I really don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m a gender traitor.) Why did I have to be gender fluid? Why couldn&amp;#39;t I be androgyne or FTM or something that actually exists according to biology? Why couldn&amp;#39;t I be some kind of gender constant so that I could be more sure of myself? Like one day I&amp;#39;ll be so sure that I feel male then I&amp;#39;ll start feeling more female and I&amp;#39;ll feel like shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022\u00a0Second: In general my existence feels like it burdens other people and I&amp;#39;m not a benefit to anyone, except maybe my imaginary friends who need me to survive. (That&amp;#39;s the only reason I didn&amp;#39;t kill myself yet; I don&amp;#39;t wanna kill them... yes I&amp;#39;m 17 and have imaginary friends, don&amp;#39;t judge me -.-) I&amp;#39;m doing less well in school, I&amp;#39;m turning into a total burnout who spends too much time online rather than studying (actually I should be studying right now but I felt I really needed to let this out), and I don&amp;#39;t go outside anymore. I literally forgot how to have fun. All I do is go on Tumblr and Reddit all day. I don&amp;#39;t do anything, I don&amp;#39;t have a life. I&amp;#39;m secretly kind of proud of that, which is what bothers me too. My mom has lectured me about this several times, saying that even my six year old cousin goes out and does stuff and wakes up early (today I woke up at 4pm and she yelled at me -- well that&amp;#39;s what I told her anyway. Actually I woke up at 8:30 and went to church, but she doesn&amp;#39;t know I go because she&amp;#39;s anti-Christianity so basically I got yelled at for something I didn&amp;#39;t do). My mom then proceeded to compare me to my one really smart, overachieving friend who got accepted to Oxford and said &amp;quot;SHE DOES SO MUCH, YOU SHOULD BE MORE LIKE HER AND SPEND MORE TIME WITH HER!&amp;quot; My mom also said that she&amp;#39;s going to call me at 10:30am on weekends every day and make sure I&amp;#39;m up, and that my dad can&amp;#39;t have me anymore if he isn&amp;#39;t home. (My dad&amp;#39;s house is kinda my safe space because my mom&amp;#39;s really overly critical and sometimes emotionally abusive.) I don&amp;#39;t do enough with my life because there are kids volunteering, doing two jobs at once, and actually working whereas I just sit around and exist all day. I already feel like enough of a nobody without her dissing me. Ugh, great, Mom. Everyone you know is fucking so much better than I am! GOOD FOR THEM, WOULD THEY LIKE A COOKIE? And if you love them so much, Mom, &lt;em&gt;why don&amp;#39;t you fucking marry them&lt;/em&gt;? (I know that sounds childish but that&amp;#39;s just how I feel, what of it.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022\u00a0I&amp;#39;m just so fucked up in general. My life literally &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a cautionary tale. Too many relationships gone wrong, too many dick moves on my part, too much idiot stuff that I said and did and regret and the worst part is &lt;em&gt;I remember every single bad move I made&lt;/em&gt;. I get mad at myself very, very easily and I hardly think that I&amp;#39;m wrong for doing so. (I&amp;#39;d rather not say what specifically I did, but let&amp;#39;s just say I&amp;#39;m not exactly the Virgin Mary nor am I one who has a perfect clean mouth and actually watches their mouth 100% of the time)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022\u00a0I find that the more time I spend online, the worse I feel... on Tumblr &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Reddit.
