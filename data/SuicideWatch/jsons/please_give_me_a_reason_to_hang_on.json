I&amp;#39;m 26 years old (I&amp;#39;ll be 27 next month), and I have social anxiety, depression, hypochondria, and Asperger&amp;#39;s Syndrome. I have a small part-time work-from home job, though I only get assignments for that job on the weekends. (I get the assignments on Saturday and they have to be completed by Sunday at 6 PM.) As for what I do with all of my free time, the answer to that is, not much. I have two volunteer positions, one at the local library and one at an organization for people with Asperger&amp;#39;s Syndrome, though it&amp;#39;s hard for me to get much done at those positions these days, since my anxiety and my depression are off the charts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These days, I spend most of my time either worrying or hating myself (or a combination of the two). It doesn&amp;#39;t help, either, that most days, I&amp;#39;m absolutely exhausted. (I&amp;#39;m guessing that&amp;#39;s due to my anxiety and depression, though I am worried that it could be a legitimate health issue. I&amp;#39;d rather not see a doctor, though, since I&amp;#39;ve grown quite cynical about doctors and medicine after years of doctors either treating me like I&amp;#39;m a waste of their time, or else refusing to take me seriously due to my hypochondria.) I have no real hobbies, since I get frustrated incredibly easily, and I constantly berate myself for doing things wrong. I used to enjoy reading, but these days, it&amp;#39;s hard for me to focus on the plot of a novel, so I&amp;#39;ve pretty much given up on reading anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for friends, I have none. There used to be some people in my life who felt bad for me and tried to befriend me, but I&amp;#39;ve drifted apart from those people, due to my social anxiety getting worse and worse. These days, my parents are the only people I talk to on a regular basis (other than my therapist, that is). It doesn&amp;#39;t help, either, that I&amp;#39;ve become an incredibly angry, unfriendly person, which doesn&amp;#39;t exactly make anyone want to befriend me these days. So I&amp;#39;m alone 95% of the time, and being alone just makes my anxiety and depression worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a younger brother, who will be graduating college in about a month. (He&amp;#39;s 3 years younger than me.) However, he refuses to have much of a relationship at all with me these days. I&amp;#39;ve tried to be friendly to him and show him I care whenever he&amp;#39;s at home (he lives in an apartment near his college), but I think he just doesn&amp;#39;t know how to talk to me in spite of my mental illnesses. I don&amp;#39;t fault him for that, of course, but it does hurt to have him be so distant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, as you can see, there isn&amp;#39;t much of a reason for me to keep holding on these days. My life is just loneliness, self-hatred, anxiety, and a sheer lack of accomplishment or drive. I can&amp;#39;t help but compare myself to my high-school classmates, and that just makes me feel like an utter failure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, yeah. That&amp;#39;s my story.
