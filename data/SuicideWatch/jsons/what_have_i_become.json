I have made two attempts at suicide in the past, and was close to another attempt on Monday 28th April. I was talked out of it by a work colleague, but considering my circumstances, I don&amp;#39;t feel like I want to live any longer and I don&amp;#39;t know what I can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 1: Formatting&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A little bit of background info about myself:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(When I started typing this, I didn&amp;#39;t expect for my *&lt;/em&gt;little bit** of background info to be so large \u2013 sorry! Also please note my dates &amp;amp; time scales are definitely not exact.)*&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a 22 year old male living in the UK, with two house mates, both male too. I have worked at a Housing Association in one of their Lettings teams for the past 3 years, and the year previous to that was spent in their Finance Department. I consider myself to be good at my job, and I am confident my colleagues would vouch for me on this. I&amp;#39;m sure this sounds all good and well, and if you happen to be reading this I imagine you are thinking \u201cwhy is this guy posting here?\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, there are other sides to me which some know about, others don&amp;#39;t, and some sides of me which nobody knows of (the latter will not be discussed in this post)... I have been a drug user since the ripe old age of 14, taking most substances spanning from cannabis to heavy psychedelics, uppers, downers, and far too many dissociatives for my own good. I have had 4 drug addictions during my years of usage, the biggest of which has been with the UK Class B substance Ketamine. Since I was 16 years old I have been a heavy user of this once amazing drug, and it has ruled my life and everything in it for the past 5 years in particular. As a result of my abuse of this substance, I have been hospitalised several times, done irreversible damage to my bladder and probably kidneys too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another product of my addiction has been debt. It started small with the odd Payday Loan being taken out on a monthly basis, and over the course of the next year or so this escalated into higher loan amounts, extended repayment periods, and of course ever increasing amounts of interest payable. Eventually I decided to take out a bank loan, to clear my overdraft, clear the \u00a3700 or so balance of my payday loans and essentially \u201cstart a fresh\u201d. This worked out well for a few months, until I started slipping on Ketamine&amp;#39;s steep, slippery slope yet again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Low and behold, I found myself back to square 1 of this financial cycle. I then did exactly what a person who is experiencing financial struggles should NOT do: Took out more credit. Repeatedly. To pay off other companies, and eventually keep up the cost of my Ketamine addiction. I won&amp;#39;t delve into the specifics of what followed, but lets just say I now stand with approximately \u00a310,000 debt spread across 6 or 7 companies. I enrolled onto a debt management plan in 2012, and that lasted for around a year until they discontinued the plan following two late of the monthly amount. I have not entered into another debt management plan since.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This addiction and debt problem has  led me into a state of depression which began about 2.5 years ago. Some of you may figure this is strange as you may have read about Ketamine&amp;#39;s use in several studies which found that it is successfully counter-effective against symptoms of depression. My only response to this is that our bodies and brains are all different, and that the subjects used in these studies were probably not heavy users of the drug before the studies began. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a a while of coping with this suspected depression I began experiencing, I eventually decided I didn&amp;#39;t want to continue this life. I made an attempt at suicide which involved several plastic bags and lots of duck tape. A friend found me in the late stages of this process, quite embarrassing I know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the next couple of months I concentrated all of my will power on staying sober. Safe to say it worked quite well, especially considering that this sobriety happened to coincide with a huge drought of the substance I was trying to avoid. Talk about good timing! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, time passed and I began stumbling down Ketamine&amp;#39;s slopes yet again. I started taking more than ever before, resulting in me taking extended periods of time off work due to Ketamine related illness. At  first my management didn&amp;#39;t know the real cause, I used to come up with some crappy excuse like stomach bugs or migraines. My increasing level of absence eventually initiated the first stage of my employer&amp;#39;s Sickness &amp;amp; Absence procedure, which placed me under review. During my first absence related meeting I told them exactly what I was going through. They were very understanding of my situation, and after setting some absence targets I was advised to contact my local GP to discuss what options might be available.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did exactly this, and shortly afterwards I began my first course of anti-depressants (Citalopram specifically). Nearly two months into this treatment I started going off the rails again, and due to another drought of Ketamine I resorted to other drugs including lots of Diazepam (Valium), Heroin (rarely) and (more) alcohol. None of the above mixed well with the Citalopram whatsoever. Once the began to properly kick in (I believe it was between the 4-6 week after starting them) I did not feel like I thought I should have. I felt like I was  experiencing life through a looking glass, and I felt far from right. After a few weeks of feeling this way, I told my GP I won&amp;#39;t continue to take the Citalopram, and I slowly reduced the dosage to non. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the medication stopped, my Ketamine and other drug use kept on going at full speed. Now I&amp;#39;m sure you may be wondering why I haven&amp;#39;t mentioned any attempt at drugs counselling in the past. I can assure you I have tried and failed 3 times with the services available in the city I live in. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Heroin use started to increased slightly, and yet again I started making myself ill through too much Ketamine, resulting in more time off which breached my absence target and started stage two out of three in my employer&amp;#39;s Sickness &amp;amp; Absence Procedure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cutting out many months of my life history so as to reduce further waste of your time, I eventually made an another attempt to take my life. This time involved a rucksack full of rocks and a nearby lake. Needless to say this attempt also failed as I was seen by a dog walker jumping into said lake... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was kept in hospital for 2 days until I was fit to return home. I was also assigned to the NHS&amp;#39; Crisis Team and began twice-weekly meetings with two of their advisers for about 3 weeks. They seemed understanding at first, though the more time I spent with them the more I felt they didn&amp;#39;t give a damn about me, and felt they were quickly trying to\u201dshrug me off\u201d of their workload. This drastically reduced my faith in the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Following that incident, I spent two weeks at my Dad &amp;amp; Step-Mums house, and of course explained everything to them. They were great, and even lent me some money to clear some overdue bills (not debts, bills) so that I was up to date with the more important finances. We spoke a lot of anti-depressants because they had both been treated for depression in the past (my Step-Mum was still being treated, though she is a massive hypochondriac anyway and takes all sorts of medication). My Dad strongly recommended that I give them another go, and contrary to what the Crisis Team advised, I began a new course of treatment, this time with the anti-depressant Fluoxetine. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the first month-ish of the Fluoxetine had passed, I began to feel better, and after some more time had passed I was even feeling GOOD. I started to perform better in my job, my absence was well on target, my relationship with my family was good. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything was going dandy, better than I could have expected. However, I continued taking drugs, normally behind the backs of friends and family. I kept ignoring calls and letters from the companies which I was in debt with, though of course that didn&amp;#39;t stop their persistence. I began thinking this was all okay, that I had to concentrate on getting clean before sorting my finances out. I&amp;#39;ve no idea where this delusional thought came from, because I was doing quite the opposite from staying clean. Admittedly I wasn&amp;#39;t taking as many drugs, but the fact stands I was continuing to use the whole time thinking \u201cit&amp;#39;ll be okay\u201d. I don&amp;#39;t want to shift the blame onto the anti-depressants I was taking, though looking back I honestly think they were altering my mind in such a way as to think \u201cDon&amp;#39;t worry, it&amp;#39;ll be okay\u201d. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are probably getting bored of reading this now. I honestly didn&amp;#39;t intend for this to be so lengthy, so I&amp;#39;ll cut to the chase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, thoughts of committing suicide have been there again. I simply don&amp;#39;t want to be here any more. And once again, I decided I was going to go through with it. Though this time would be different. This time wouldn&amp;#39;t be spur of the moment, I&amp;#39;ll do it properly. So I booked a well earned week off work, the first since the start of 2014 actually, and thankfully just after my payday. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the last week, I made sure to visit my Mum, my friends, spend time with my dog, pay a few people back (not my Dad, for reasons unknown), and get well and truly FUCKED UP.  I had the idea in my head that at the end of this holiday I wouldn&amp;#39;t actually return to work, instead I would hang myself in my garage. The week was great, had a fantastic time, but the whole while this exhilarating thought of \u201cit&amp;#39;ll all be over soon\u201d was forever present in my head. It felt better than some of the drugs I have taken this past week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this leads me up to near the end of my story. I woke up yesterday morning, and began to read up on the different methods of hanging oneself. After spending my morning with my phone set to aeroplane mode to ignore contact from work, I sat and researched the most effective hanging methods available. I planned it all out. I would set up my slip-knot noose, hang it from the garage ceiling, make a wrap to keep my hands tied behind my back, and get drunk to help me take my final steps. I decided to aim for constriction of my Carotid Artery, hoping to induce the supposedly pain-free unconscious state for my final breaths. I was more than confident that if my Carotid Artery wasn&amp;#39;t constricted enough that I would be able persevere through the strangulation part of the process. I didn&amp;#39;t plan to leave a note.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All was going well, having a sing-along to Morrissey &amp;amp; Radiohead and drinking my favourite beer. By the time 3.30pm came, I entered the garage for what I thought would be the final time, stood on my stool, set the noose around my neck at the ready, drank the last of my beer, and had two practice runs. They didn&amp;#39;t go as well as I had hoped, but I was drunk enough to keep going. A little later, I put the hand wrap on, but then my phone rang. I figured I&amp;#39;d answer as nothing would matter in 30 minutes time. It was a close colleague from work. Naturally she was concerned about where I had been all day, so I told her exactly what I was doing at that moment in time. She began to plead for me to stop what I was doing, and tried to remind me that nothing can&amp;#39;t be fixed in life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This response angered me because I began to feel guilty about what I was about to do. I hung up on her in a drunken rage and made the decision to take her advice for now. I went back inside my house, lay down in bed and broke into tears myself. What have I become? What is happening to me? I&amp;#39;ve become a selfish, lying coward who nearly hurt everyone who has only ever been good to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did not go into work again today either because I was still in a state. I have had friends and family trying to contact me to check I am ok. My Mum even came to my door yesterday evening shortly after the incident, though I refused to let her in because I am too ashamed to tell her the truth. The manager of the department I work in also came knocking on my door this afternoon, but I didn&amp;#39;t let him in for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, my current circumstances are:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*I want to commit suicide because I don&amp;#39;t feel like I want to live any more, but I couldn&amp;#39;t bring myself to actually do it when the time came. Maybe next time I should turn my phone off to avoid any distractions...&lt;br/&gt;\n*During what I thought would be my final few weeks I have not paid any bills, not even rent \u2013 my house mates do not know this. No payment to my Dad. Spent all of my money on drugs and beer (not any Ketamine though!).&lt;br/&gt;\n*I have been ignoring all of my friends and family who have tried to contact me&lt;br/&gt;\n*I am probably going to lose my job because these two days I have not been into work have pushed me through to stage 3 of the Sickness &amp;amp; Absence procedure I mentioned earlier, which is a final review and probable dismissal&lt;br/&gt;\n*I have debts amounting to approx. \u00a310,000.

Set the goal and keep it in sight.

So lets say your goal is to move away for a new start. Your objectives then would be to do everything that would help you achieve that goal.

So it's bad discipline to take drugs because it takes you away from your goal, it hijacks your mind and you waste money which could be used as savings to leave.\n\nYou have to visualize a future for yourself and literally create it one step at a time. Of course the same applies to any goal you set.\n\nThe debt is a tricky one, I can say all I want to say about the banks and the debt but it's your situation. I would say to tell them fuck off or go into them and tell them that your addicted to drugs and you'll never get the money back but that could be bad advice if it's used against you in court if they sue you. In my opinion i wouldn't worry too much over debts and warning letters and even if it gets taken to court. Whats the worst that can happen, it's impossible to go to jail over it. Your history with drugs and loans is in your favor and you could use that as leverage to negotiate a set amount to repay with no interest because they will just be wasting their time pursuing you.

Why don&amp;#39;t you focus on moving away and just leave behind the debt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Set yourself the goal of leaving all the shit behind and move to a new country for a new start. Set the goal and keep it in sight. It is possible and you just have to focus on that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aims and objectives, You have to set yourself an over all aim and then set little objectives and each one brings you closer to your goal. So lets say your goal is to move away for a new start. Your objectives then would be to do everything that would help you achieve that goal. That is called discipline, you are aware of the patterns that brought you to this place, like the drugs. So it&amp;#39;s bad discipline to take drugs because it takes you away from your goal, it hijacks your mind and you waste money which could be used as savings to leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to visualize a future for yourself and literally create it one step at a time. Of course the same applies to any goal you set.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The debt is a tricky one, I can say all I want to say about the banks and the debt but it&amp;#39;s your situation. I would say to tell them fuck off or go into them and tell them that your addicted to drugs and you&amp;#39;ll never get the money back but that could be bad advice if it&amp;#39;s used against you in court if they sue you. In my opinion i wouldn&amp;#39;t worry too much over debts and warning letters and even if it gets taken to court. Whats the worst that can happen, it&amp;#39;s impossible to go to jail over it.
