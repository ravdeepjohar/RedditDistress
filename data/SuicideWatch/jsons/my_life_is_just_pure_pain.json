I just need to type it out, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m a lazy guy with social anxiety. I\u2019ve also battled depression 1-2 years ago. It got good. Now it\u2019s worse.

I was wrong. So now, several months later, I still haven\u2019t even come close to trying getting a job. In fact, I\u2019m just sitting home, too tired and depressed to take action. So I\u2019m living at home with my parents with no income, no money. I\u2019m just a burden for my parents. They pressure me to get a job. My girlfriend in another city is sad because we can barely meet, and that I don\u2019t give my 100% to get a job, I have no money, she\u2019d be better off me because I\u2019m just a burden and worthless, really. I don\u2019t want to tell her I\u2019m depressed again. She helped me last time, I have too much guilt for her to help me again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the anxiety is just killing me. I\u2019m thinking of suicide like I\u2019ve never done before. I\u2019m planning, thinking on what songs I\u2019d have on my funeral, the suicide note, etc. Before that my logic always stopped me from doing those thoughts, but I\u2019ve just lost hope, I know there is nothing after death, but who cares, I just don\u2019t want to suffer. I know I\u2019m a failure, I don\u2019t want to talk to people because they will realize I\u2019m awkward, I don\u2019t want to embarrass my family in front of relatives, so I dodge the family gathering because of it etc. I don\u2019t even want to go outside because maybe some people who know me see what retard I\u2019ve become. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have trouble getting friends or even have a normal conversation with people. I just. I suck.\nI realize I need help, I really do. I\u2019m in queue for a shrink but it\u2019s expected to take 2 months before I get help. Fuck that shit.
