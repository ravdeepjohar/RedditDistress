One can have the best sentiments for you but still feel overwhelmed if you present them with a problem they don't understand and just run away.

I know the feeling when \"I could make everything be over by tonight\" becomes a happy thought. I don't have your exact background, never had to deal with actual mental illness or drug abuse, but I know being in a bad place, I can sympathise. But sympathy isn't enough. Sympathy doesn't tell me what an autistic young man needs to find his place in society, how to move on from self-medicating with street drugs, how to straighten oneself up after picking up on plainly delinquent behaviours. I, just like most people, have no clue about those!\n\nThat's where I say \"ask a professional\". And I say this knowing that bad therapy can be traumatic. Risk it, at this point you're looking for options other than suicide, I think it's worth a try. Getting help doesn't mean you'll end up on pills, if that prospect scares you. A good psychologist will help you figure out what you need, what form of therapy might suit you, what steps you can take in your everyday life to get it back together, etc. while taking your input about it seriously.\n\ntl;dr: Your life is more complicated than what laypeople can handle and a professional might be the only person who can help you at this point.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would be insulting your intelligence if I assumed you had a way to deal with your issues alone but somehow didn&amp;#39;t figure it out by now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you can&amp;#39;t get help from your family because you&amp;#39;re violent, and no matter what good intentions they may have, they&amp;#39;ll protect themselves first, and can&amp;#39;t be blamed for that. Attempting to help someone involves a lot of trial and error and stepping on your toes would most certainly happen, and it doesn&amp;#39;t sound like you made them comfortable to risk it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Friends? Well you can try to open up to friends, but that&amp;#39;ll really depend on the type of person they are. One can have the best sentiments for you but still feel overwhelmed if you present them with a problem they don&amp;#39;t understand and just run away. Some other friends aren&amp;#39;t that good friends and will leave the moment they see you at your worst, and frankly, that&amp;#39;s not something one wants to find out when they&amp;#39;re depressed!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel ya.
