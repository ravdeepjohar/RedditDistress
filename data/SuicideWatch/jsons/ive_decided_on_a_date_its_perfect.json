I realized that I would either spend the rest of my life with this girl or she is going to leave me and I am going to kill myself. I always knew in the end she was going to crush me. I don&amp;#39;t know why I let her do it, but it was always going to obviously happen. When our problems really came to a boiling point a month or so ago, I was honestly moments away from killing myself one night. But I managed to get her to take me back and continue on with life. But I can&amp;#39;t force her to love me when she just doesn&amp;#39;t anymore. In my fucked up brain ending it is the only way to stop feeling this pain. The way I am wired, my brain is convinced that I cannot handle this, I cannot persevere, etc. And honestly, it&amp;#39;s the truth. I just am not a person who can handle what she did to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_24mjm0", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ch8mvoq", "created": 1399167509.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1399138709.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "saved": false, "id": "ch8mov9", "gilded": 0, "author": "lilsunnybee", "parent_id": "t3_24mjm0", "approved_by": null, "body": "Are you taking any medications to help?
