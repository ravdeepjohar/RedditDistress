But the opposite is equally powerful. The positive emotions we experience can be equally (if not more) powerful.

By realising that it is within your power to take control over your situation, make plans, and decisions on how to take control of your life, it empowers you. It builds confidence, it can show you that you as an individual are not only valuable and important, but also powerful and capable of enriching the lives of your friends, your family, your community, and the world.\n\nI'd also like to say that it's important to honestly think about all the positive things that will go away if you take this drastic, irreversible step.
