I graduated from a top ten law school last year and passed the New York bar exam. I didn&amp;#39;t do well in law school to say the least. Midway through, I attempted suicide, had a mental breakdown, and needed to take an extra semester in order to graduate. I have been taking antidepressants and battling depression since I was 14 years old.

I&amp;#39;ve been applying to whatever positions I am qualified for, but this job search method has seemed hopeless, and my law school hasn&amp;#39;t provided much else in terms of assistance. So many of my classmates have big firm jobs, impressive clerkships, or influential work, but I know that will never be an option for me because of my grades.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted so badly to leave my home state. I have no network in New York, and even if I did, I don&amp;#39;t have the confidence or charisma to make a difference.

If they saw me now and knew my situation, I don&amp;#39;t think I could bear their disappointment. My father&amp;#39;s evident disappoint is bad enough -- he had been so proud of my past accomplishments and future intentions. So had I, but now I feel like it has been all a waste. I&amp;#39;m in a hole and I can&amp;#39;t see myself digging out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to give up. I don&amp;#39;t want to be a burden on my parents anymore.
