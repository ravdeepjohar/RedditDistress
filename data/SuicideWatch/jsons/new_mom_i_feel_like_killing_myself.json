This is where you see the idea of \"it takes a village\" go into effect. If you need to turn to other people right now to help you care for your baby while you care for yourself, there's no guilt in that. Just because having children is \"natural\", that doesn't somehow equate to it being simple, seamless, and effortless. \n\nHere's an excerpt from Brooke Shield's book, Down Came The Rain\n\n&gt;At first I thought what I was feeling was just exhaustion, but with it came an overriding sense of panic that I had never felt before. Rowan kept crying, and I began to dread the moment when Chris would bring her back to me. I started to experience a sick sensation in my stomach; it was as if a vise were tightening around my chest. Instead of the nervous anxiety that often accompanies panic, a feeling of devastation overcame me. I hardly moved. Sitting on my bed, I let out a deep, slow, guttural wail. I wasn\u2019t simply emotional or weepy, like I had been told I might be. This was something quite different. In the past, if I got depressed or if I felt sad or down, I knew I could counteract it with exercise, a good night\u2019s sleep, or a nice dinner with a friend. If PMS made me introspective or melancholy, or if the pressures of life made me gloomy, I knew these feelings wouldn\u2019t last forever. But this was sadness of a shockingly different magnitude. It felt as if it would never go away....\n\n&gt;\"I was incapable of holding or looking at or kissing or smelling my perfect tiny little baby. I'd hide in the shower in a fetal position\u2014and put the hot water on and hope it would melt me away... He [her husband] came up to me one day and said, 'Why don't you sing to her? Why don't you smile at her?'\"...\"I was beginning to seriously plan ways I could disappear quietly but permanently,\"...\n\n&gt;...I watched as Chris finished the diapering, and felt like a beached whale. I was failing at things that, according to popular belief, were supposed to be the most natural in a woman\u2019s life. I had never been uncomfortable around babies, and they always responded positively to me. In fact, it sometimes surprised people when their babies opened their arms to me so quickly. Everybody always said that I would make a great mom one day. I tried to rationalize that I was physically impaired and should give myself a break, but I didn\u2019t have any desire to power through and care for this baby. I got hit with a wave of self-defeat and self-loathing and had an urge to smash my head against the wall repeatedly. Chris told me to get off my feet and back into bed. Once there, my crying recommenced, and I started strongly believing that I couldn\u2019t be a mother. I was already proving to be incompetent, and we hadn\u2019t been home a day! What had I done? Why didn\u2019t I want to be near my baby?...\n\n&gt;...I started to sob once more. I sat up with my huge legs stretched out in front of me and, slowly rocking back and forth with my face up toward the ceiling, my arms limp at my sides, I sobbed. I couldn\u2019t stop. What was I going to do? Was I ever going to stop feeling like this? Misery enveloped me.\n\n&gt;I really needed to rest, but we seemed to be in an unrelenting routine of sporadic sleep, baby care, and lots of tears. The baby would wake up every hour and a half, and I would struggle to get her latched on. By the time she was on and had eaten a meal (if she stayed awake long enough to finish one), it was time to start all over again. Just as I would begin to fall into an exhausted sleep, Rowan\u2019s little bark, like Chinese water torture, would wake me up. This schedule continued incessantly and, thinking that it would be like this forever, I began to feel delirious. I was practically inconsolable. I couldn\u2019t stand any of it.\n\n&gt;...I had never felt emotion like this, and I strongly believed that even if I could articulate what I was experiencing, nobody would understand, not even my husband. And if he did understand, he certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to help. Chris kept doing all he could to keep the baby contented while continuing to try to talk to me. I knew he must be tired, too, but we couldn\u2019t seem to get on a schedule that allowed one of us to sleep while the other tended to the infant. Plus, I was afraid to let Chris sleep, because I was scared to be alone. Even though we were in the same apartment, if he was sleeping and I was awake, I thought I might try to escape or wouldn\u2019t be able to stop myself from swallowing a bottle of pills. I even thought that I\u2019d welcome being kidnapped. These were strange, irrational fears that still felt real to me...\n\n&gt;...After only a couple of days of being home, my crying had increased and no longer occurred only in between feedings but during them as well. At times I even had trouble holding Rowan because of my choking sobs. Why was I crying more than my baby? Here I was, finally the mother of a beautiful baby girl I had worked so hard to have, and I felt like my life was over. Where was the bliss? Where was the happiness that I had expected to feel by becoming a mother? She was my baby; the baby I had wanted for so long. Why didn\u2019t I feel remotely comforted by having or holding her?...\n\n&gt;...It occurred to me that my life was no longer my own and that I was a prisoner to a small, squeaking creature. I did not like it one bit. I felt stuck. I did not want the responsibility this situation demanded. I started feeling like I had made a terrible mistake in having this child. I would look at how little and vulnerable she was and didn\u2019t feel at all capable of tending to her needs. Her helplessness terrified me. Rather than wanting to care for her, I wanted to forget her and run away.\n\n&gt;...I had thought that it would all get better once we got home, but it was unbelievably worse. I felt no connection to my daughter and wanted to die because of it. She grew inside my body, for God\u2019s sake, and I didn\u2019t even feel related to her. I had always thought I would immediately feel closer to my child than I did to anybody else in my life. I\u2019d thought we would be undeniably bonded from the moment I laid eyes on her. What was wrong with me? What a horrible mother I was! Her cry didn\u2019t annoy me or grate on my nerves, but it also didn\u2019t register with me, either. I felt numb to it. I practically had to strain to hear her voice, which seemed so far away, even though she was in the adjoining room and the door was open. I could almost justify not hearing it.\n\n&gt;My profound detachment made me suffer unbearably, and I believed I had nowhere to turn. I remember looking out of the bedroom window and envisioning myself jumping. I concluded that it wouldn\u2019t be too effective, because we weren\u2019t high enough. This upset me even more. The frightening part was that my thoughts were extremely rational. They made clear sense to me. It felt like an appealing option to erase myself from this life. What would stop me from acting on any of these thoughts? I needed and wanted a way out. My mind was full of visions of escape, and these constantly overshadowed thoughts about my miraculous baby girl.\n\n&gt;During what was becoming one of the darkest points in my life, I sat holding my newborn and could not avoid the image of her flying through the air and hitting the wall in front of me. I had no desire to hurt my baby and didn\u2019t see myself as the one throwing her, thank God, but the wall morphed into a video game, and in it her little body smacked the surface and slid down onto the floor. I was horrified, and although I knew deep in my soul that I would not harm her, the image all but destroyed me...\n", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congrats on your update, OP.

I&amp;#39;d hide in the shower in a fetal position\u2014and put the hot water on and hope it would melt me away... He [her husband] came up to me one day and said, &amp;#39;Why don&amp;#39;t you sing to her? Why don&amp;#39;t you smile at her?&amp;#39;&amp;quot;...&amp;quot;I was beginning to seriously plan ways I could disappear quietly but permanently,&amp;quot;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...I watched as Chris finished the diapering, and felt like a beached whale. I was failing at things that, according to popular belief, were supposed to be the most natural in a woman\u2019s life. I had never been uncomfortable around babies, and they always responded positively to me. In fact, it sometimes surprised people when their babies opened their arms to me so quickly. Everybody always said that I would make a great mom one day. I tried to rationalize that I was physically impaired and should give myself a break, but I didn\u2019t have any desire to power through and care for this baby. I got hit with a wave of self-defeat and self-loathing and had an urge to smash my head against the wall repeatedly. Chris told me to get off my feet and back into bed. Once there, my crying recommenced, and I started strongly believing that I couldn\u2019t be a mother. I was already proving to be incompetent, and we hadn\u2019t been home a day! What had I done? Why didn\u2019t I want to be near my baby?...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...I started to sob once more. I sat up with my huge legs stretched out in front of me and, slowly rocking back and forth with my face up toward the ceiling, my arms limp at my sides, I sobbed. I couldn\u2019t stop. What was I going to do? Was I ever going to stop feeling like this? Misery enveloped me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really needed to rest, but we seemed to be in an unrelenting routine of sporadic sleep, baby care, and lots of tears. The baby would wake up every hour and a half, and I would struggle to get her latched on. By the time she was on and had eaten a meal (if she stayed awake long enough to finish one), it was time to start all over again. Just as I would begin to fall into an exhausted sleep, Rowan\u2019s little bark, like Chinese water torture, would wake me up. This schedule continued incessantly and, thinking that it would be like this forever, I began to feel delirious. I was practically inconsolable. I couldn\u2019t stand any of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...I had never felt emotion like this, and I strongly believed that even if I could articulate what I was experiencing, nobody would understand, not even my husband. And if he did understand, he certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to help. Chris kept doing all he could to keep the baby contented while continuing to try to talk to me. I knew he must be tired, too, but we couldn\u2019t seem to get on a schedule that allowed one of us to sleep while the other tended to the infant. Plus, I was afraid to let Chris sleep, because I was scared to be alone. Even though we were in the same apartment, if he was sleeping and I was awake, I thought I might try to escape or wouldn\u2019t be able to stop myself from swallowing a bottle of pills. I even thought that I\u2019d welcome being kidnapped. These were strange, irrational fears that still felt real to me...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...After only a couple of days of being home, my crying had increased and no longer occurred only in between feedings but during them as well. At times I even had trouble holding Rowan because of my choking sobs. Why was I crying more than my baby? Here I was, finally the mother of a beautiful baby girl I had worked so hard to have, and I felt like my life was over. Where was the bliss? Where was the happiness that I had expected to feel by becoming a mother? She was my baby; the baby I had wanted for so long. Why didn\u2019t I feel remotely comforted by having or holding her?...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...It occurred to me that my life was no longer my own and that I was a prisoner to a small, squeaking creature. I did not like it one bit. I felt stuck. I did not want the responsibility this situation demanded. I started feeling like I had made a terrible mistake in having this child. I would look at how little and vulnerable she was and didn\u2019t feel at all capable of tending to her needs. Her helplessness terrified me. Rather than wanting to care for her, I wanted to forget her and run away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...I had thought that it would all get better once we got home, but it was unbelievably worse. I felt no connection to my daughter and wanted to die because of it. She grew inside my body, for God\u2019s sake, and I didn\u2019t even feel related to her. I had always thought I would immediately feel closer to my child than I did to anybody else in my life. I\u2019d thought we would be undeniably bonded from the moment I laid eyes on her. What was wrong with me? What a horrible mother I was! Her cry didn\u2019t annoy me or grate on my nerves, but it also didn\u2019t register with me, either. I felt numb to it. I practically had to strain to hear her voice, which seemed so far away, even though she was in the adjoining room and the door was open. I could almost justify not hearing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My profound detachment made me suffer unbearably, and I believed I had nowhere to turn. I remember looking out of the bedroom window and envisioning myself jumping. I concluded that it wouldn\u2019t be too effective, because we weren\u2019t high enough. This upset me even more. The frightening part was that my thoughts were extremely rational. They made clear sense to me. It felt like an appealing option to erase myself from this life. What would stop me from acting on any of these thoughts? I needed and wanted a way out. My mind was full of visions of escape, and these constantly overshadowed thoughts about my miraculous baby girl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During what was becoming one of the darkest points in my life, I sat holding my newborn and could not avoid the image of her flying through the air and hitting the wall in front of me. I had no desire to hurt my baby and didn\u2019t see myself as the one throwing her, thank God, but the wall morphed into a video game, and in it her little body smacked the surface and slid down onto the floor. I was horrified, and although I knew deep in my soul that I would not harm her, the image all but destroyed me...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_252kim", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_cheb332", "created": 1399735220.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1399706420.0, "distinguished": null, "num_reports": null, "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qpzs", "banned_by": null, "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "likes": null, "replies": "", "saved": false, "id": "chdbpqy", "gilded": 0, "author": "opentoinput", "parent_id": "t3_252kim", "approved_by": null, "body": "Please read this\n\nhttp://www.babycenter.com/0_harvey-karps-happiest-baby-method-for-baby-sleep-and-soothin_10373838.bc\nHave to do every step correctly and it works\n\nThis isn't the guy who invented it.\n\nI saw the original guy take three hysterical babies and make them happy in one minute each.
