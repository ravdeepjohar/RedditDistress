I&amp;#39;ve never been a very happy person, and I currently see a therapist for severe anxiety and depression. Today, I made my first major step in 21 years towards happiness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back in 2007/08, I was 15, and I met my first love. This girl was beautiful. I was with her every waking moment and I was head over heels in love. But naturally, things began to break down. Eventually, she turned into.. Someone else. She hurt me for fun, until that unforgettable night in August 08. She told me straight up she was going to cheat. I was powerless, she was out with this guy and I was laid in bed, unable to do anything but cry. She broke my heart, and I thought that was game over for me. I attempted suicide, I failed and I moved on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2010, and I&amp;#39;m finally ready to open up again. She was intelligent, funny, and her smile put the stars to shame. A few months in we were at a party together, and she told me she loved me for the first time. My smile touched my ears, I kissed her, and I told her I loved her too. That same night, she drunkenly slept with one of my best friends. I forgave her, and we went another year. Another year of torture, it was always at the back of my mind. I wanted to spend my life with this girl, but I just couldn&amp;#39;t. Eventually the lack of trust broke us apart, and I was done for. I actually feared love.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jump ahead again to March, last year, when I meet a girl in Leeds. I was scared, but she opened me up and warmed my heart, and I fell for her. I went to a party to see her (Getting to Leeds is about 45mins on the train, so I didn&amp;#39;t see her regularly). I saw her in the corridor, and she sprinted up to me, grabbed me and kissed me for the first time. In front of everybody. It was like a movie scene, only without the cameras, the good looking guy and of course... The happy ending. That same night, the girls went to see live bands while the guys played football. We got back first and I waited for her excitedly. She eventually returned, with another guy, slept with him and never spoke to me again. I left at 5am, sat at the station for 3 hours and thought about just.. Jumping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But life goes on. And in August last year, I started hanging with a girl I&amp;#39;ve known as an acquaintance since I was a child. She quickly became my best friend. Now.. How I&amp;#39;ve spoken about these girls is true, and while they all had their unique personalities and all beautiful - This one was the diamond. We did everything together, nobody could get us away from eachother, and I fell in love. We were very intimate, we did sleep together twice, but she never quite felt the same way back, which hurt. Nevertheless, I loved this girl more than I&amp;#39;ve ever loved anything in my life. When I was with her, time stopped, nothing else mattered. Now I&amp;#39;m crying haha, but anyway. Last night, I was with her, and she was texting this other guy all night. When she left, she just shut me out. Completely. She still won&amp;#39;t speak to me. I spent all night last night crying, and I wanted to die. End it. Nothing mattered anymore. One minute I was with her laughing, seeing her beautiful smile and knowing it was for me. Next minute, gone. I was just about to kill myself, but I just couldn&amp;#39;t do it. And here&amp;#39;s why.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back in 2011, in August (I hate August), my dad attempted suicide. I&amp;#39;m thankful every day that he survived, but the effect it had on me was devastating. So I didn&amp;#39;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now, reddit, you&amp;#39;re thinking - Where&amp;#39;s this going?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up today, and I refused to be upset. Heartbreak is a powerful thing, when used correctly. I&amp;#39;ve chosen to better myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to slam the door on my life, my friends, my job - everything. And just start again. But the past is what defines you. So instead, I left the door open, and I opened a new one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve decided to power through my shitty minimum wage job to pay for the Accounting course I applied for today. I&amp;#39;ve decided to make more friends, and make people feel happy. I&amp;#39;ve decided to be happy. And I am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still hurt, and I cry, but I&amp;#39;m taking steps to make myself better. You may hate yourself, hate your body, and hate your life. But those things never say a bad word about you. Treat them well, actively drive yourself towards happiness, and good luck to every single one of you through your troubles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you ever need a friend, a shoulder, or just somebody to listen. I&amp;#39;m here for you. All of you. Let&amp;#39;s get through this together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Love. Live.
