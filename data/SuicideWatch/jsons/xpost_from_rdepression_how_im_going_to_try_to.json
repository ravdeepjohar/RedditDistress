The reason why I became depressed is because I hate who I turned into. I turned into a shitty, asshole, fucking jack ass, lazy piece of shit. Right at this moment, I hate who I am. I hate who Ive turned into. I don&amp;#39;t want to go into details, but Ive done a lot of things that I am really not proud of. I have failed over and over again. I have lied. I have abused relationships, and my self.\nSo heres what Im gonna do.\nMaybe if this much failure, this much screwing up leads to this much depression, then maybe THAT much success and then some, can drive me out of this hole. Heres what Ive done. I started a notebook, and have broken down the last 2 and a half years into 4-6 month intervals. Every thing I screwed up in that time period, Im going to try to make up for by fixing the screw-ups, and making up for them in a way.\nExample #1: From September 2013 - February 2014, I gained 50 pounds. Im going to lose the 60 pounds, and achieve two fitness goals: Run a 5K + Be able to do 20 pushups.\nExample #2: I wasted so much time doing absolutely nothing from September 2011 - December 2011. Im going to learn two new skills &amp;quot;Skill A and Skill B&amp;quot; + Im going to read those two books Ive been meaning to read for a while.\nExample #3: I had zero life from Month A to Month D. Im gonna dip into my savings, travel for a week to a city not too far away that Ive always wanted to see. Then just for the hell of it Im gonna go skydiving. Why not.\nAnyways\u2026 it sounded like a good idea to me. Maybe it will to some of you guys to.\nBest of luck killing depression :)\nEDIT: It feels really hard to start. Depression can really suck the motivation out of you. But heres something interesting I read yesterday - &amp;quot;Motivation at the beginning of trying to do something isn&amp;#39;t effective. The motivation that develops as you go along your path is much stronger.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "\nHi r/suicidewatch,\n\nIve been battling depression for just about 2 years now.
