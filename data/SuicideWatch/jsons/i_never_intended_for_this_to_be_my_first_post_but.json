I apologise if I come across that way, but I&amp;#39;m not. I just need somewhere to vent, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So first things first.\u00a0I&amp;#39;m bipolar, though I&amp;#39;d prefer to say have it, as I&amp;#39;m a damn sight more than my malfunctioning parts, but it explains a lot.\u00a0I&amp;#39;m currently taking\u00a0Fluoxetine, just to see how it goes and feeling worse than ever. It&amp;#39;ll pass, at least that&amp;#39;s what they tell me, but I&amp;#39;ve started becoming even more reckless and irrational than I ever was before.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#39;m up, I&amp;#39;m up. I&amp;#39;m in love with the universe. I&amp;#39;m invincible, immortal, and I don&amp;#39;t give a fuck. When I&amp;#39;m down, I can&amp;#39;t stop the unpleasant thoughts and feelings overwhelming me. I don&amp;#39;t want to talk, to get involved with anything, because everything I touch I ruin, and ruin beyond repair when I try to fix it. Every relationship I have with friends and family just further showcases my worthlessness. I get tired, so fucking tired of it all. And I know how pathetic it is to feel that way, and I try not to, but what&amp;#39;s the point? I kept it to myself, didn&amp;#39;t bother anyone, and it ate me up. I&amp;#39;ve attempted to off myself twice in the last two weeks, the first was out of desperation, half hearted and sloppy, the second time, today, I would have succeeded. That thought frightens me.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suicide isn&amp;#39;t something I plan, the urge just sneaks upon me or steadily grows too great to ignore. I&amp;#39;m a sensible person, I know my death would affect and effect more than my immediate being and surroundings. I know it&amp;#39;s selfish. But sometimes I think being here causes more pain than not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Admitting I needed help was the hard part. Having to explain myself to a stranger was humiliating, but she respected my refusal for therapy sessions, filled out my prescriptions, and sent me on my merry way. Tell someone, she said, talk to someone. And that&amp;#39;s where things get a little tricky.\u00a0The very people who care about me are the very people I could never tell, because I have to protect them from it. I have to put on my act and keep smiling.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t talk to my parents, that&amp;#39;s completely out of the question. My father would think a lot less of me, and despite what softer individuals might say, I would only disappoint him. My mother spiraled out of control before, and suffered my father&amp;#39;s cold, unsympathetic attitude, and I&amp;#39;m ashamed to say I played a part in that. Holding it together is what I excelled at, and I looked down on her. I thought she wasn&amp;#39;t strong enough, or tough enough, she needed to get a grip and pull herself together. Now I&amp;#39;m where she was all those years ago, scraping rock bottom, and I finally understand how easy it would be just to let go.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for friends? I&amp;#39;m not sure you could call them that. They&amp;#39;re folks I&amp;#39;ve shared experiences with, but there&amp;#39;s no connection on any sort of level, deep or otherwise.\u00a0I did tell someone, but immediately regretted it. It was a huge mistake.\u00a0The timing, the way it was phrased, it just seemed like some desperate attempt to get a rise out of them, at least they said as much. Any other interactions after that point were strained, to the point where I was accused of deliberately pushing buttons and stirring up drama they could really do without.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my defence, I&amp;#39;m not a dramatic\u00a0person. I keep myself to myself. I like things simple and low key. When it gets all fucked up, it gives me a headache and I can&amp;#39;t rest until it&amp;#39;s sorted out. Failing that, I detach myself from the situation completely, isolate as best I can. In general, I don&amp;#39;t draw attention and I hate\u00a0showing any signs of weakness. I guess depression has such a stigma nowadays it completely overrides individual character.\u00a0It makes me feel sick that I actually told them, but sicker still that they think so little of me, but\u00a0I honestly had nowhere else to turn.\u00a0To other people, I&amp;#39;m\u00a0nothing but a fucking inconvenience. That&amp;#39;s what my entire existence boils down to, and it&amp;#39;s true.\u00a0But some folks don&amp;#39;t mind being inconvenienced.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a complete stranger sit with me for twenty minutes today, just chit chatting away, holding me the entire time. They were late for work, I was late for work, their children late for school, but they put me first, I was the most important person to them at that point. The guilt I had for upsetting their day was washed away with such honest and loving words. They were there right when I needed them, but it was pure luck they were passing by and luck is unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m here.
