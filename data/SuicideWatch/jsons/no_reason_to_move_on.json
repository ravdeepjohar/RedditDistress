I am making the assumption that home is a safe place. From personal experience, I was still at home until I turned 23. Moving out isn't cheap, depending on where you live you'll be forking out from $500-1000 a month just for a roof over your head and running water.

You mentioned you dropped out of college. With that I want to ask you a simple question, did you enter your degree for you or for someone else? College isn't for everyone, thats why I suggested a skilled trade. It might be more to your liking. Spend some time thinking about what YOU want to do with your life! Have fun with the brain storming process and try a whole bunch of different things. Scour the web to see what makes you excited.\n\n5. I don't see and issue with not wanting a drivers licence. There's a lot out there, not all of it is going to bring you satisfaction.
