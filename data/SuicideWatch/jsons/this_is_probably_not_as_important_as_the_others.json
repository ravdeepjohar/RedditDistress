Sometimes the path we THINK we should be on, is not the path that is best suited for us. Sometimes depression is caused by oppression and there's something in out hearts that we aren't listening to. \n\nYou might think your friends are too busy or wouldn't understand, but if they are real friends they will make the time for you and listen to you unconditionally. All you need to say is \"Hey, I am having a rough time- can we just hang out?\" Most friends will do anything to help the people they love out, and I am sure people love you. You are clearly a considerate person because you care about your family and friends time and feelings, they are not careless back.
