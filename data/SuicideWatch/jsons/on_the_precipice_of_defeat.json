I&amp;#39;ve lost precious people, betrayed close friends of mine, dissapointed my parents and teachers. In high school I changed my life style and that might have been for the worse. I have totaly pushed back everyone who thought they were meaningful to me. I have since chosen to follow my dream. I&amp;#39;ve sacrificed alot in the hopes achieving that dream and now that I am very close, I&amp;#39;ve begun to break down. Having constant regrets about all those decisions I&amp;#39;ve made thus far - cast away all my friends and loved ones, isolating myself from any human contact. \nOn the other hand I am afraid because if I devote myself towards achieving that dream and were to fail I wouldn&amp;#39;t have much left in my life to live for. What I am left with is an emtpy void of regrets, knowing that I cannot go back to what was.. and can only go forward, the only problem is that fear has taken control of me. I don&amp;#39;t have the courage to face further problems that could lie ahead of me. Fear is taking over both my body and soul and I cannot go back or go forward. I don&amp;#39;t see what the choice is here... Should I leave all the hard work I&amp;#39;ve put in my dream so far and try(somehow) and come back to reality OR push and hope that I succeed with what I set out to do since the start. Failure at both would leave me with even more regrets, hatred, pain and that is not something I can live with... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would like to hear ANY advice from people on this subreddit. \nThank you for the time and sorry for bad english.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": " Hi im 19 years old and im about to graduate from high school(thank god). \n Troughout my life I've had multiple misfortunes.
