Go with your SO and cross the country, or even move to a different one if you feel like it!  \nThere are lots of great people to meet and jobs to get!\n\nEven if this is no possibility for you, I suggest taking a vacation to another country.

I had been living my entire live in some boring european village, and nothing give me a bigger kick then going to the states and visiting the everglades!\n\nThis was also the point where I decided that I did not want to kill myself anymore.
