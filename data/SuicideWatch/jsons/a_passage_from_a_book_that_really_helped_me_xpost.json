I&amp;#39;m not currently experiencing a depressive episode, but in the midst of my most recent one, this passage from &amp;quot;Self-Esteem&amp;quot; by Matthew McKay and Patrick Fanning really helped me out.

The first two methods of talking back are important, but they aren&amp;#39;t enough. You can&amp;#39;t permanently turn off the critic&amp;#39;s vitriol by calling him names, telling him to shut up, and insisting that he costs too much. That helps for a while. But you&amp;#39;re creating a vacuum by silencing the critic without putting anything in his place. And soon enough his voice will be back, filling the vacuum with more attacks. When the critic has been silenced, you need to replace his voice with a positive awareness of your own worth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Affirming your worth is no easy task. Right now you believe that your worth depends on your behaviour. Metaphorically, you see yourself as an empty vessel that must be filled, drop by drop, with your achievements.

The critic would have you believe that there is no intrinsic value in a life, only a potential for doing something worthwhile, something important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is that your value is your consciousness, your ability to perceive and experience. The value of a human life is that it exists. You are a complex miracle of creation. You are a person who is trying to live, and that makes you as worthwhile as every other person who is trying to do the same thing. Achievement has nothing to do with it. Whatever you do, whatever you contribute should come not from the need to prove your value, but from the natural flow of your aliveness.

You have looked out at the world and tried to make sense of it, you have coped with the unique set of problems you were born into, you have endured pain. Over the years you&amp;#39;ve tried many strategies to help you feel better in the face of pain. Some of your strategies have worked, some haven&amp;#39;t. Some have worked short-term, but in the long run brought greater distress. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter. You are just trying to live. And in spite of all that is hard in life, you are still trying.
