(she&amp;#39;s away) she met a new guy.. they started off as friends.. and i also got to know this guy as just being a friend to her and her friends too confirmed that it was nothing more than good friends.. but i had my apprehensions due to his advances to her. then one day i heard that she had been going out with him to pubs and getting drunk which was so unlike her normal behaviour. this happened many times and we always used to have bad fights regarding this. she used to tell me everything but only much later. and then one fateful day they both got so drunk and they both kissed(thats what she told me sometime back that he forced himself on her) she was shocked and she told me after 2 days. i was unable to contain such thoughts in my head and obviously i thought of the worst that could&amp;#39;ve happend and i accused her of cheating me and she was very sad and she popped some pills and tried to suicide.. i did not talk to her that day but the next day upon learning of this incident i got back to her and i told her that i wont ever leave her and that everything would be okay. and i got her smiling again. we were both very happy for over a week.. but i started having insecurities of my own and continued to assualt her reminding her about this incident and cursing her badly at times which i personally regret very much. but she started going out with the same guy again very soon.. and a week after my birthday( btw on my birthday she called me up and she sounded so different she wasnt even excited anymore like she used to be) she tells me she doesnt love me anymore and that she doesnt deserve to be treated like i treated her.. and that she found a better person. she never told me who she found.. but she hurt herself and tried to send me pictures telling me she&amp;#39;s been doing things with someone else and that i should just leave her because she is just cheating me. i couldn&amp;#39;t believe what i was seeing .. because she was someone i held onto so dearly.. i always considered her my wife.. i loved her with all my heart.. even though i wud get angry at her often i always made sure that i showed her how much i regret and how much i love her. but i think she was hurt so much.. maybe she really doesnt to be with me.. to this day i really dont know what is happening with her.. i dont know if she really is dating someone else.. or sleeping with someone else.. or if all what she said was some device to keep me at bay.. because i knew her too well.. and i know she loved me so much and i still dont understand how she could just leave me so easily without giving me one more chance.. i know she has forgiven me many a times.. especially when she caught me doing weed which she completely loathes.. (btw im not hardcore stoner i just do weed occasionally with certain friends and in certain situations). i respect her. yet she tells me i dont respect her. she told me she hates me with all her heart for making her life difficult. i have contemplated suicide many times.. because she was the one thing that i molded my life around and when she took off.. i feel like evrything is collapsing.. i feel like its not worth living anymore.. although i feel better these days.. but all of my waking moments are spent thinking about her and i find myself getting up from bed everyday with a heavy heart. i still mourn for her.. i feel like i killed someone.. my friends tell me its not my fault.. but somehow i feel terribly guilty and i have a deep feeling inside me that i could&amp;#39;ve averted all this if i had dome something different.. said something different.. but i could not.. i feel like i have failed miserably and i feel like this is not going to go away.. i feel like this is a cross that will weigh me down forever. i wish i could&amp;#39;ve been a better person for her.. we had shared so many dreams together..but all of that is shattered now. i cant stop blaming myself for being the person who shattered it all.. and thats what hurts the most.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "i've been with her for over an year.. we used to be old classmates and used to study in the same class 6 years ago until we met again over an year ago and within a few months we started our relationship. she lives away in another country. but her homeland is where i stay currently. she returns for 3 months every year and those would the best days we have had.we both have had sex for the first time.. lost out virginities to each other and we loved each other very much. my mom and a few of my family members knows her and although she's from an orthodox muslim community my mom and family still felt positive about it. she never used to drink prior to being with me.. i got her drunk many times but we always were safe and had loads of fun.then she took off to study to the other country. everything was going fine until 2 months ago..
