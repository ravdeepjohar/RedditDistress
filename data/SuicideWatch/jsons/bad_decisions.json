I have made my decision and will go through with what I have planned for myself.

I will not be checking back into this account, any replies would be a waste of your time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do NOT marry a woman with kids. I know there are some success stories out there, and I\u2019m happy for you. But I\u2019m about to tell you what 7 years of a step daughter who fucked up my life, my marriage and my \u201cfamily\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I put \u201cfamily\u201d in quotes because any step-parent knows that they are never really \u201cfamily\u201d. You are only around when they need you, when there are problems with your spouse\u2019s kid, they don\u2019t want you involved even when said kid steals from you, accuses you of beating your wife, lies, manipulates, coerces others to conspire against you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the past 6 years, her youngest has been a problem. She has done all of the above, and many people told me to run. Run as fast and as far away as you can. I didn\u2019t listen. I loved my wife and I believed that things would work out by standing by her side, trying to work together and she did accept my help at one point. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When her kid got pregnant, we moved her into our home.  She wanted her loser boyfriend to come along, I reluctantly agreed because I knew there was no way to win this argument. I would have had to suffer under months of nagging and fighting. Long story short, this piece of shit did nothing around the house, acted like she owned it, pushed me around both physically and emotionally and there was nothing I could do outside of leaving my wife. I didn\u2019t want to at the time, but now? Shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all the years of supporting her and her damn kids, I needed the support. 4 months of me being at the end of my rope, and she says \u201cI\u2019m done. I can\u2019t take it\u201d. Well, fuck you honey. 4 months of damage towards you versus 6 years of her damage to me and you can\u2019t take it anymore?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I will kill myself. I won\u2019t do it at home because I don\u2019t want to be found by anyone I know. I have a location, method and date that will not harm anyone else. No one will see or know anything, but I will call the morgue and give them the location for the pickup before it\u2019s done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love you Reddit. You\u2019ve been my best friends for a few years. I wish things were different, but they aren\u2019t. I can\u2019t go on anymore. Things will seem normal to everyone else until it happens. I\u2019ve had to plaster a smile on my face for years, I can do it for a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - Don&amp;#39;t be a step parent with an emotionally ill kid. They will suck the life out of you and cause you to lose everything you worked for.
