Let me tell you it is fuking insane just how easy it is to crush someones spirit and soul and whatever it is that we all claim to have,. I lost all my friends he didnt like them, and im not surprised they didnt try and help me out of this rut, im a complete wreck by 3 years but i was still nievely clinging to this shred, this tiny ass shard of light that we had every so often. eventually it got so bad that he felt it appropriate to put bruises down my shoulders and back. cant say that i blame him. with all my bitching about him going out every weekend and spending our money on useless gym equipment and fucking cigerettes, alcohol and god knows what else i mean what else could he do? That night i packed up my clothes and left the house that we OWNED and went to my friends house. wana know something really cool though? I felt so emotionally deprived and physically negelected that i had the bright idea to become a prostitute. I had a full time job already but i could barely afford board let alone live on my own.. Imagine that though? selling yourself just so that someone can be nice to you. Now, i am not a drug user of any kind, nor do i smoke, and obviously i have children to support. he just left me feeling so dead and ashamed and broken and lost that i had no idea what to do. a month later he has a new girlfriend 4 years older than him fantastic. Having no friends left and was publicially discraced as a hooker I ran away to the capital of our contary, friendless, and alone. and now here i am, 2 months later still here still friendless and still alone. I really dont think i can handle life anymore, i doubt i was even equipped for it. jesus christ I ramble. I am now 19 years old and am completly alone in a city i know nothing about with no family and clearly no friends. i go to work and i come home and sit on my laptop. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think ill just fade out of the world, as it clearly doesn&amp;#39;t need my presence. nobody wants a broken, deprived girl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anybody took all the time to read this, damn that means alot to me.
