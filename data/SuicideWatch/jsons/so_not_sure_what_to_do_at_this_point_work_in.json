Its in the south and its not a culture I enjoy at all.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I want to do is run out west to a state like California, Oregon, or Washington (or any nearby state to that).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only issue is that this current job will pay for a college degree (which I could get one I&amp;#39;m actually interested in), which could let to a better job in a city I enjoy in 2-3 years.  But by then I will be 28 or 29.  I would have missed out on my 20s which I have already missed out mostly up to this point.  I can&amp;#39;t stand living here for another 2 years, I can&amp;#39;t see myself doing it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other issue is I have a possible health concern and want health insurance and a secure job.  If I leave this job, I lose that as well.  Supposedly Obamacare is suppose to help in situations like this, but I don&amp;#39;t know how that would work.  If I lose my job, I really don&amp;#39;t think I would be covered for healthcare for free and probably couldn&amp;#39;t afford what they would charge me if they base it off what I make now (vs. me making zero, but the government still labeling me as having an income).  I&amp;#39;m not making a lot either, but enough to pay for an apartment, food, etc..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All I wish I could do is go run to California and get a job learning programming or work in finance.  Work for a secure company and work a secure job there.  Enjoy my job and where I live for once.  Not miss out on my 20s like I&amp;#39;m doing in this city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is that too much to ask?  What am I suppose to do?  Is there anyone in one of these states offering jobs in one of those things?  I doubt anyone would offer a job on this subreddit, but I guess it can&amp;#39;t hurt to ask.  I do work for a well known financial company and as a licensed broker.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wonder though if the only out I have is just leaving.  All I want to do is live in one of those states.  Or hell, Canada on the west coast would work too (then I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to worry about the healthcare issue anymore).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone out there have advice or anything?
