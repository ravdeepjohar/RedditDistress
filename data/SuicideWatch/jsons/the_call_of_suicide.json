I know this illness I suffer from is an illness of insight. So my logic for posting is to get an outside perspective on my current state of mind. For context, I\u2019m a 21 year old student. Young I know, don\u2019t remind me. I\u2019ve suffered from depressive symptoms for too long a time. They first emerged when I was about 9 or 10 and at the time they were quite mild. Unfortunately, my depression has had an insidious course since. I even consider the possibility that the depression I suffer from is not an illness, but rather a personality trait. And although I have moments (sometimes even weeks) of reprieve I have come to accept that it is deeply ingrained within me and here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the past year it has increased in severity so much that the burden it confers on my life is too much to handle. In particular, the last two months, with the exacerbation of certain symptoms, namely anxiety, social withdrawal, loss of concentration, avolition and psychomotor retardation, life has become unbearable. This naturally contributes to my desire to die.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have tried so hard to fix this. Medications appear to have little impact. Interpersonal psychotherapy was distressing and offered no benefit. CBT didn\u2019t seem to help. I have tried engaging in the \u201cLifestyle modifications\u201d. I currently force myself through the motions of exercise but this appears to have the little impact too. I am left feeling skeptical of anything that promises the potential of alleviating symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have lost all function in my life. I am failing academically, socially, and personally. I hate myself, inside and out. Every facet of my life has turned to shit. I consider the damage that depression has done to my psyche as extensive. Similarly, the work required to fix any malfunctioning part of my life would be extensive too. This is quite a problem, as currently I can\u2019t even bring myself to take a shower in the morning time. Reintegrating into society and becoming a wholesome person does not appear to be a possibility. I fear I am broken beyond repair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am quickly approaching the critical point. Suicide is generally accepted in the context of chronic illness, where electing to kill oneself on consideration of the suffering ahead is rational. I believe that refractory depression is no different. My chosen suicide method is peaceful and offers the ultimate reprieve. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suicide seems inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been meaning to make a post for quite a while.
