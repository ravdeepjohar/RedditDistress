My husband is freaking out over it, and the relationship is emotionally &amp;amp; occasionally physically abusive, so no prizes for guessing who he&amp;#39;s taking it out on.\nI&amp;#39;ve started the process of selling my car, the only thing I have to my name in this world, to pay for his attorney to help his situation concerning his two kids, but somehow I&amp;#39;m still the one to blame. He&amp;#39;ll scream at me for 2-3 hours CONSTANTLY, not letting me talk at all, blaming all his stress on me because &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m such a loser&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t listen to him&amp;quot;, he &amp;quot;does everything for [me]&amp;quot;, etc. He constantly rips me to shreds over my childhood (&amp;quot;your father must have really messed you up&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;didn&amp;#39;t anyone care about you?&amp;quot;) and insults everything about me as a person.\nThese incidents happen maybe once every two weeks normally, but now they&amp;#39;re happening every other day. I&amp;#39;ve already started missing my period over stress (TMI, sorry) which is heartbreaking to me because we&amp;#39;ve been trying to have a child and now we can&amp;#39;t even try. Every time he does this, I spend the rest of the night thinking of ways to just end it while he sleeps like a fucking baby. If I don&amp;#39;t stay up and think about it, I dream about it and every time I dream of suicide it feels more and more like the right way to go.\nWe had another screaming match today. Well, 3 to be exact. the first two were an hour long each, and the last made it to almost 4 hours with him screaming about how hurt he is and me with my hand over my mouth as to not anger him further. The thoughts have already started, I caught myself looking up methods on my phone so he wouldn&amp;#39;t see the search history, but I&amp;#39;m still scared.
