The good, the bad, and everything in between blur into the distance. I have many regrets in life, with spots of anger scattered along the timeline like algae on a old warship. The age is vivid along her hull, bruised from her great victories, but crippled by her loses and age. I have become vividly aware of my illness, the intoxication of anger and alcohol seeps through me on a genetic and natural level. When I was younger I grew to accept the darkness, while poverty and child abuse lost its grip on me years ago, it left a deep poison in my heart. The crumbling of my family spiraled me into an abyss that I would never climb out of, but for only glimpses of my life light would shine deep into the well of my existence.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stand at a cross road, my alcoholism has led down a path once walked by my father, and his father before him. The chains of abuse, recklessness, and arrogance have a hold on me that only a man of the same conviction can comprehend. I wait in agony and not in fear of knowing if I still spend time in prison for my transgressions. With only a few months of sobriety under my belt I search for answers. Why am I so engulfed by alcohol, how can someone go from blissful happiness to violent rage in a matter of minutes.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have spent the past few months searching for the answer to these questions, but to no avail have I found an answer. I have only found preventative solutions, mild solace, and more questions. I am ill, soulfully tired, and out of ideas for such a problem. I need not the judgment of greater men to know if I am a threat to society. With all the community service I have done in my life, care I have given my family, mentorship I have given others, and life changing impact I have had on others, I find no justification or imbalance of my worth. I have in my past slapped a woman, choked a woman, and been verbally abusive. In my own context I am a monster, hidden from the family and friends I love by intellect and compassion. It is the ones you love me the most that should feel the safest, but I am ill, I am an alcoholic, and this is just not the case with me. I am the essence of a threat to society, in that I am a threat only to those who love me the most.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a deep part of me that cannot sleep, moves quickly through life out of fear, cannot sit still, or live in the present. While some people come from violent homes and upbringings, they can move forward in life, I am afraid I am not so blessed. I can still feel the blood between my toes on the wooden floor, the feeling of the hot iron tip piercing my back, and the sounds of screaming still haunt me. I have found happiness in being \u201cdistracted\u201d, always working, always moving, always smiling, always laughing. But it is all nothing more than simply a distraction. I am and always have been depressed inside, hating myself, fearing myself, at odds with myself. The voice in my head narrates what to do, as if I am a spectator to my own life, always accepting one&amp;#39;s decisions, but never truly accepting one\u2019s feelings.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have hurt others, women who have placed their hearts in my hands, and futures at my feet. But I am not worth of such gifts, these tokens of life are better suited for stronger men. I can truly say I do not know what a loving relationship is, for I have never seen one from the inside. I do not know how a father truly shows affection or a wife truly shows love to her family. I am not disciplined in love or emotions, I only know the chaos and fiery pit of an abusive home. Such life lessons should not be taken for granted. While I sit here and await my judgment, I can only fixate myself on that time in a psychiatric center, time in prison, or gracious probation will not fix me. I am a habitual abuser, and while all incidents are isolated, they exist. You can water a plant everyday and give it sunlight, but if one day you tear it from its roots it will die. I do not trust my ability to prevent such outliers in my behavior, or the prison system to show me how to prevent such things from happening. With all the quantitative training I have, this will fall outside the model of predictability. With this I have a choice, endure my judicial punishment and hope it will fix me or create a guarantee that it will never happen again.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know suicide is considered the cowardly path by many, too much by some, and never the right choice by all. However, I was told by my mother when I was young God had bestowed upon me the burden of breaking the abusive cycle. With three generations fully active as abusive lovers, it is my burden to carry. Such things should never be handed down in life to your children, but like life you are given strengths and weaknesses to balance. Thrust into the world to cope with them without mercy. I am an abusive boyfriend and in fear of one day being an abusive husband. Being the third generation to bare the name *****, I feel it is my character flaw to destroy, for the sake of society, for the sake of my family, and for the sake of any woman I may hurt in the future. With only a few weeks left of freedom, my time to decide my fate is decreasing and I know everyday I am out of jail, someone is living in fear. This I cannot live with anymore and have chosen my options accordingly. The cycle of abuse will end with me, by me and for me. I am tired of this monster, this burden, this demon. So in death we will part.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S.&lt;br/&gt;\n    To my Father, who will probably be hurt by this the most. We had our run in life, our existence, and our blessings. But our legacy, be it our name, being a part of the ***** community, and rain of terror is over. Feel not the pain of losing a son, but solace in the end of era. We are not, and are still not worthy of the love the women in our lives have given us. We have abused them, physically harmed them, and in times crushed them under our feet. We are the bane of love for many, find peace in the degradation of your health, for I know you will be joining me soon.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "This is from user /u/forgetbooze.\n\n[Original thread here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/23toss/i_have_been_suicidal_for_months_today_i_walked/)\n\nI've removed the thread from /r/stopdrinking, but if you reply to that link, the original user should still get your replies.\n \n--- \n**I have been suicidal for months, today I walked out of AA early and finally wrote a suicide letter...** \n\nDear Family, Friends, and past Women who have loved me,  \n\nI think of how to sum up the last 28 years of my life.
