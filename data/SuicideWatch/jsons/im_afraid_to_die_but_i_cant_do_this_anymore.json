And while he has been lovely and understanding, all the baggage that remained from my last two relationships along with the terrible place I&amp;#39;m in, has made it really hard to be with him. I am sad all the time. And fearful for what will come next. It&amp;#39;s hard to enjoy him. It&amp;#39;s hard to enjoy anything. And I feel guilty because I am bringing so much baggage with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I texted him something stupid tonight, something self-deprecating and selfish and felt so afraid he would leave me that I didn&amp;#39;t want to live anymore. The thought of crawling out of my hole, facing my debt, facing flunking out of school, facing my exhausting serving job, and feeling sad about my ex... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I keep thinking, while I&amp;#39;m standing on the subway platform, that I&amp;#39;m just a few steps away from relief.
