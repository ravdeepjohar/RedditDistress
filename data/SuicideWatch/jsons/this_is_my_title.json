All my problems have been unfolding at once. I do not know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know where to start so yeah, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At school I made my own table at the begging of the first semester, the table was a full one, I guess you could say I was &amp;quot;popular.&amp;quot; Now, only me and my girlfriend sit at that table. I know this sound stupid but it really hurts it made me lonely and sad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All my friends that still sat at that table (about 3-4) left while I was at home because I was diagnosed with bronchitis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now my girlfriend has anxiety and goes to the therapist. She cries a lot. I hate when she cries. We used to fight a lot, too. One day I couldn&amp;#39;t take it anymore and I tried to break up with her. She ended up balling her heart out in tears. We agreed to wait a week to see if it got better. Later that day she basicly said she would kill herself if we broke up. It ended up getting better. All my close friends (not the ones at lunch) know I want to break up with her. I still love her but at times I don&amp;#39;t, she and I have changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that I am pretty sad I started to do bad at soccer. Which sucks ass because I have districts this weekend. I have done terrible at the last 3 practices and when everyone is yelling at me I just do worse. Tonight I even started crying. No one noticed, hell, I barely did. It was just one of those tears that come out when you get sad, I didn&amp;#39;t make a face or anything like that. It blended in with sweat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before all these damn problems started happening I was a pretty happy person. One night my girlfriend and I had sex. She told her friend. Her friend had betrayed her. She told people and some people know but romurs spread like wildfire. Soon the hole school will know about it. When we had sex it felt so right, like we would be happy and together forever. But now, it feels like a mistake. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;School has recently gotten harder, mostly algebra. I am having to stay up late and waking up early to do homework. I feel so blugh throughout the day. I am not motivated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents have always been drinkers and I hear them at 2 in the morning skinny dipping in the pool on a school night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All these things are just making me feel like shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there an easy and painless way to go?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I get older will I have less problems?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will it be less stressful?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you,\ncantwaittill&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS: I&amp;#39;m on a phone so the text may be wrong.
