I am getting horrible intrusive thoughts and they are getting more common and they make me uncomfortable. I was so depressed i dissociate sometimes and i do impulsive things and i feel so much shame and guilt it makes me want to die and im getting suicidal intrusive thoughts like slitting my throat and i cant tell whether ill continue hurting myself in small ways with my bad decisions or if ill hurt myself in a big way. I dont feel like i fit my body my family my life and i feel sick when i think about all the things ive done in reckless and sort of nihilistic way. The worst thing is that i rationalized my bad behaviour and didnt feel bad. How can i feel bad when im not living my life and there are no consequences for things? But now i am bearing so much guilt, which i have always had anyway and now its been multiplied and i burn with shame. The worst part is that i recognize that there will probably be no harm done and that other people might not feel as strongly as i do but it is very real for me and i can barely handle it. I dont fit this existence and i dont want to be a part of any of this. I dont want to continue living my awkwardness and self imposed loneliness and neurotic personality. People see me as attractive and nice and i see that, but i dont care . My anxiety disorder is getting out of hand and i clench my teeth even in my waking hours. I havent talked to my friends in months. I havent actually created anything in years or done anything besides work part time. I have nothing because i let it all fade away. Its my fault and another consequence that i dont want to deal with. I dont want to be the unlucky girl anymore. The one who cant walk without falling or talk without stuttering. I want to not be emotionally dysfuntional and if i cant be those things i dont want to be anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I (20f) am very unhealthy right now and my thinking patterns have been very disturbed and i am getting very neurotic because of my depression and anxiety disorder and what i think is either agoraphobia or mild ptsd.
