I was dating a guy long distance for about six months. He lives in Australia, I live in the US. I broke up with him recently, even though I&amp;#39;m still in love with him, because I felt like our relationship was unrealistic and it was too hard for me to continue pursuing. He mentioned once when we first started dating that he thought he might have bipolar disorder because his father did, but for the rest of the relationship he covered up all of his episodes because he didn&amp;#39;t want to &amp;quot;burden me&amp;quot; with it. Now that we have broken up, he doesn&amp;#39;t see a reason to live anymore. He tried committing suicide recently and failed, and his friend (the only friend of his that I can contact) took him to the hospital. He&amp;#39;s now on meds and will start seeing a therapist soon, but he still wants to kill himself. He hasn&amp;#39;t waited to see if the meds will stabilize him (takes a few weeks), or if therapy will help. He doesn&amp;#39;t want to wait. On one hand, he tells me that i wasn&amp;#39;t his only source of happiness and that he had a lot of goals beyond our relationship, but then he says things that completely nullify that. He asked me when school was over for me so he could kill himself without me worrying about it during my final exams. He told me he didn&amp;#39;t see a reason to go on without me, and that he felt like I was the only thing that made life worth it. He&amp;#39;s told me that I&amp;#39;m the only person that makes him happy. When I told him that I couldn&amp;#39;t tell him I loved him anymore, because I felt like it was stringing him along and that it was making things worse, he started making more threats of suicide. I&amp;#39;m not sure what to do. I think, as an ex and someone he is still in love with, being friends with him is only making him more attached and making it harder for him to move on. On the other hand, I can&amp;#39;t force him to get help because I&amp;#39;m very far away. His friend is doing the best she can to help, but she can&amp;#39;t be with him day and night. Every time we speak, we end up arguing about why we broke up because he doesn&amp;#39;t think my reasons are good enough, and even though I repeatedly told him that its unhealthy to have expectations and rely on someone so much in a relationship, he doesn&amp;#39;t agree with me. He doesn&amp;#39;t see anything wrong with it, and he doesn&amp;#39;t see why he should find happiness somewhere else because he thinks its impossible.
