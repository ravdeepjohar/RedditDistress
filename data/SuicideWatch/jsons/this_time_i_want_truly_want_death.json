We are nothing but an evolutionary byproduct of billions of years of gradual change. We are not special as a species. Our interactions are just as inherently pedantic as the social interactions of ants. Every single thing we feel, ranging from the extacies of romance to the depths of depression (you are here!),  is nothing but a chemical reaction going off in our neurotic heads. Everything is premeditated. I think that&amp;#39;s why I love alcohol and drugs so much. They give me the ability to act under the guise of subconsciousness. Everything we do on earth is meaningless. Nothing is truly altruistic. Every single decision we make on earth is to evoke some feeling,  some chemical reaction, in order to make our selves feel some sort of self importance. Tonight I opened my drawer with my gun in it,  simply to see what it felt like. To have the end that close was envigorating. Every single day for the past two months I think about, no,  I long for the inevitable peace that death will bring. The only things keeping me here are my friends and family. I am content with my story,  the story of Andrew Shelton ending right now. Even if it went on for another century,  the resul would be only fractionally less meaningless than what it is currently. This vacuum of time and space that is our universe is truly a cruel place. I am reminded of the Epicurean quote &amp;quot;I was not,  then I came to be; now I am dead,  and I do not care.&amp;quot; I long so dearly to no longer care. To have that last fringe of superficially emotional, truly chemical, sliver of care removed from me. I do not wish to die because I am unhappy. I wish to die because death is happiness,  because happiness is not existing. This is so radically different than my melodramatic high-school suicide attempt. I couldn&amp;#39;t take the struggles of life then,  and while I may not be able to now either,  I long for death for completely different reasons. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else here have such a nihilistic view of life?
