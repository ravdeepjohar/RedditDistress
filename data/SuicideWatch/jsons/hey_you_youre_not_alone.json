Today was a horrible day, one of the worst in a while. It seems that the bad days are increasingly frequent. The &amp;#39;good days&amp;#39; are becoming sparse. You tried to keep it together - to wear the mask. It slipped, multiple times. Leaving you in tears. You feel incredibly alone. You&amp;#39;re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today was spent reading stories of suicide - ones with happy endings and others with &amp;#39;happy&amp;#39; endings. You wondered when your turn is. You know it&amp;#39;s just a matter of time. You know that you&amp;#39;ll die by your own hand - you just don&amp;#39;t know when. Will you have the strength when the time comes? No one will care, you&amp;#39;re alone. You&amp;#39;re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You cried today, your cheeks are sticky from the salty streams. You sat in your car after working a job you once loved. You could only cry, and you did for ten minutes. You aren&amp;#39;t in pain. You aren&amp;#39;t sad. You aren&amp;#39;t anything - You can&amp;#39;t feel ANYTHING. You want so badly to reach out to &amp;#39;friends&amp;#39;, but the prospect scares the fuck out of you. Besides, you&amp;#39;ve distanced yourself from all your friends. They&amp;#39;ve demonstrated on multiple occasions that they can&amp;#39;t handle your swings. Instead, you distance yourself even more. You retreat into yourself - alone. You&amp;#39;re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You realized you needed to cook tonight. You stopped by the store. You bought all the ingredients you need. The lady in front of you had two kids, they wanted candy. She let them get it... but ended up being short. As she started to decide what to put back, you told the cashier to not put anything back, that you&amp;#39;d pay for the overage. You are a kind soul, you do things like this very frequently. Normally, it brings you to cloud nine, indescribably happy but today.... Today it did nothing. You still felt completely empty, completely alone. You&amp;#39;re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you were cooking, you fantasized about how you could slice yourself. Release the blood from your veins, become light headed, fall... and sleep. Eternally. No one would know, no one would care because you&amp;#39;re alone. But you&amp;#39;re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You sit now, alone in your room, reading words on your computer screen. Your cheeks are soaked, your eyes ache from the constant tears. These words blur under the sheen sheet of tears. If only you had a friend, if only someone cared, if you could only reach out and get help... If only you weren&amp;#39;t so fucking alone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#39;re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You Are Not Alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re alone, then I&amp;#39;m alone - and I don&amp;#39;t want to be alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey you, you're not alone.
